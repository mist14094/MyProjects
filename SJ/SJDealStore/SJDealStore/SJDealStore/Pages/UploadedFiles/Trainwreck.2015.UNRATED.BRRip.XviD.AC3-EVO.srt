1
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:31,218
Girls, your mother and I
are getting divorced.

2
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,720
Don't cry.

3
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:34,988
I know you're upset.
I know you're confused.

4
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,723
I don't know
what your mother told you,

5
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,759
but let me explain it
from my side,

6
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,861
in terms you can understand.

7
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:47,260
You got your doll, right?
You got your doll there.

8
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:47,934
Yeah.

9
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,509
You got your doll. You
like your doll, right?

10
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:49,902
Yes.

11
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:51,671
- You love your doll.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:53,305
Yes, you love the doll.

13
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,807
But what if I told you...

14
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,690
that was the only doll you're allowed
to play with the rest of your life?

15
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:02,314
- How would you feel?
- Sad.

16
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,416
You'd feel sad. Of course.

17
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:06,317
'Cause there's a lot of
other dolls on your shelves.

18
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,254
And if you play with the other dolls,
you can't have that doll anymore.

19
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,990
Even though that doll doesn't really
want to play with you at this point.

20
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:14,326
You're both living a lie.

21
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:17,796
There's other dolls you like, and
they're making new dolls every year.

22
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:20,199
- You want a stewardess doll?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,635
What about a slightly overweight
cocktail waitress doll? - Yeah.

24
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:26,338
What about a doll who happens to be
best friends with your main doll?

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,139
Yeah. It could happen, right?

26
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:29,607
Yeah.

27
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:31,775
A doll you only play with
one day and never see again?

28
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:33,277
Yeah!

29
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,379
What about a doll where your
friend's playing with a doll,

30
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:38,716
and he needs you to, you know, kind
of man up with the other doll.

31
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:40,884
You don't even wanna play
with that doll, but you do it...

32
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:42,518
'cause your friend's
playing with that doll.

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,387
You don't wanna sit there and
leave the other doll unattended.

34
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:46,122
Yeah.

35
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:48,657
So that's why me and Mom
are getting divorced.

36
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,527
Monogamy isn't realistic.

37
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:54,396
Monogamy isn't realistic.

38
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:57,699
- Again!
- Monogamy isn't realistic.

39
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,701
Again!

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,039
I never do this.

41
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,075
This is<i> so</i> weird for me.

42
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:16,983
I really like these ones.

43
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,051
Oh, no!

44
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:20,820
Shit!

45
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,688
- That's your dick?
- Uh-huh.

46
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,658
Too big! Your dick doesn't end.

47
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,594
Why doesn't your dick end?

48
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,529
Have you ever fucked
someone before?

49
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,932
Where is she buried?

50
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:36,935
That looks like the whole
cast of<i> Game of Thrones.</i>

51
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:39,405
Come here.

52
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,676
Um, you know what? Huh?

53
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:47,178
I'm, like, really shy. Uh-huh.

54
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,915
So we should probably do this first so
I, like, feel comfortable with you.

55
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,216
Yeah, all right. You know?

56
00:02:52,218 --> 00:02:53,884
It's just... Mm.

57
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,752
A little warm-up. I know.
Yeah, a little warm-up.

58
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:57,354
Hey, you taste like mango.

59
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:59,122
Just stop talking, okay? Okay.

60
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:01,190
Just, like... What are you...

61
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:03,026
Just do the alphabet.

62
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:05,962
Just hang up at the top. Everything
important's up at the top.

63
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:07,930
Yeah, that's good.

64
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,966
Okay.

65
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,109
Hey, you like that, right?

66
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,378
Amy?

67
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,247
Hey.

68
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,881
I think it's my turn, baby.

69
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:32,118
Amy. Seriously, my turn.

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,080
Muffin, remember you said
you were gonna...

71
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,557
Okay.

72
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,599
<i>Hey, guys, I'm Amy.</i>

73
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:49,801
<i>Don't judge me, fuckers!</i>

74
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,770
<i>I'm just a sexual girl, okay?</i>

75
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:54,973
<i>I am fine. I am in control.</i>

76
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:58,577
Okay, bye. <i>This is clearly
not my first rodeo.</i>

77
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:01,980
<i>The key is to never ever,
let them sleep over.</i>

78
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:05,351
Tell you what, I got a couple of ticks,
uh, to The Black Keys, Thursday, if you...

79
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,785
Ooh, thanks.

80
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,320
Bye.

81
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:11,823
All right, good night.

82
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,857
All right, bye. Good night. Oh.

83
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,028
I guess I do love pussy.

84
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:23,967
<i>Look, I have a great job
and my apartment's sick...</i>

85
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:25,702
<i>and my friends and family
are awesome,</i>

86
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:28,005
<i>and I'm sort of
seeing someone...</i>

87
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,140
<i>and this dude's not him.</i>

88
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:34,044
<i>This guy is who I'm seeing.</i>

89
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,645
<i>Kind of.</i>

90
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,880
<i>He's hot, right?</i>

91
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,950
<i>He is great, but it is like
fucking an ice sculpture.</i>

92
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,556
<i>Okay, so I broke
the sleepover rule.</i>

93
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,357
<i>Where am I?</i>

94
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,326
Scarface<i> poster? Ugh.</i>

95
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:53,795
<i>Please don't be a dorm room.
Please don't be a dorm room.</i>

96
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:56,198
There she is.
<i>Buenos días,</i> baby.

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,401
Oh, my God! You
look like an angel.

98
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:02,738
What time is it? It's
like 7:30 in the morning.

99
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,307
I don't know if I should let you
sleep or not or make you breakfast.

100
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:06,841
I chose breakfast.

101
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:08,844
Where am I?

102
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,478
Oh, you're in
Staten Island, sugar.

103
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,246
What?

104
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,482
Fuck!

105
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:16,917
Hey, so when you think
I'm gonna see you again?

106
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,585
Soon. Like really, really soon.

107
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:20,921
You don't gotta rush off. Oh.

108
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,590
My God. You're stunning.

109
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:26,560
Thank you. Hey, so Saturday...

110
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:28,495
Saturday my aunt
is getting married,

111
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,263
and she's having
a little barbecue beforehand,

112
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:32,399
and I would love it
if you were my date, baby.

113
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:35,068
Like, if I walked in with you,
oh, my God,

114
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,040
Johnny would be like, "Yo!
Oli, what's up, kid? Great."

115
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:43,043
Like, who's that piece, you know?
She's body down."

116
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:46,213
I don't know what that means,
but, like, I can't do that...

117
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:50,351
because, like, you and I won't
ever see each other again.

118
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:54,187
I didn't think you were gonna follow
up so quick about hanging out,

119
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:56,456
but this is it for us.
Well, but...

120
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,524
Our journey is over.

121
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,893
Like it just ends here...
Till Saturday.

122
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,263
No... Our journey is over now...

123
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,231
because I probably won't see you
because I gotta get to work...

124
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:09,703
and you gotta go be fine as hell.
Good-bye.

125
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,739
I got Bikram yoga, so...

126
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,242
Hey, you can say whatever you
want, baby, but hips don't lie.

127
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,277
Hey, check your Twitter.
I might Direct Message you.

128
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,778
Might DM.

129
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,649
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

130
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,663
Noam, watch out. Good morning.

131
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,633
Oh, Amy!
There she is, my princess.

132
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,301
What happened?
Did church let out early?

133
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,869
Ha-ha.

134
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,671
Hey! Amy, where you going?

135
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:23,339
This isn't Planned Parenthood.

136
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,981
Oh, my God! Shut up.

137
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,849
You have to tell me
everything about last night.

138
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:37,319
I went on your Instagram.
That guy is, like, so hot.

139
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:39,789
He looks kind of like
a white Drake. No.

140
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,491
He was like a Puerto Rican Gollum.
I'm not talking about it.

141
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:44,627
Do you have to pee?
Yeah, totally.

142
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:48,931
Did you hear Johnny Depp is
coming into the office today?

143
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:49,999
Oh, yeah. I'm all over that.

144
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,901
Which version of Johnny Depp
you most wanna have sex with?

145
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:55,703
Like, which one does it for you the most?
'Cause I can't stop thinking about it.

146
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:57,539
For me, it's
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

147
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,474
Like, I love a fully made up,
Really?

148
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:02,811
Long hair, like, almost
feminine-looking Johnny Depp.

149
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:05,513
Not "almost." Like, he looks like
a beautiful woman in that movie.

150
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,481
Yeah. Who would be yours?

151
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:10,384
I'm picking, like, an<i> Edward
Scissorhands</i> Johnny Depp.

152
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,219
You would get totally cut up.

153
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:14,222
Like, you... Yeah, but he'd
feel so bad about it...

154
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,823
that he'd be, like,
"I'll never leave you."

155
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,926
And I would get, like, a sick haircut.
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:21,863
But also, guess what. Willy
Wonka, like, bring it on.

157
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,664
Oh, my God. Totally. Right?

158
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,268
Would... Yeah. Would fuck the shit
out of Willy Wonka Johnny Depp.

159
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,004
Okay, my babes,
I want your undivided.

160
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:33,208
I've been looking at your pitches,
and these are my thoughts.

161
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,045
Nikki. Why are you smiling?

162
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,748
I'm not smiling.
I'm just very nervous.

163
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,383
Stop smiling. Stop smiling.

164
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,185
That's even more.

165
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:44,774
Nikki.

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,121
The more nervous I get,
the more I smile, so...

167
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,056
Stop smiling.

168
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,626
Stop it. Stop it.

169
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,928
Nikki, shut it down. Come on.
Bring it down.

170
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:54,695
Bring it down.

171
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,197
That's it.

172
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,132
I'm sick of your
ginger nonsense.

173
00:08:58,134 --> 00:09:00,868
I don't want to see
those gnashers. No.

174
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,537
Stop it. What's this?

175
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:04,438
That's our new intern, Donald.

176
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Thought we were getting
a chick, but he's here.

177
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,643
Okay. Welcome, Donald.

178
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:11,078
Welcome to<i> S'nuff,</i> where we are
teaching the strong-willed man...

179
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,913
how to dress, think, eat, fuck.

180
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:15,249
Do you like the magazine, Donald?
Oh, yeah.

181
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:17,384
It's pretty much all I read.
Good answer.

182
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:21,155
Look. This is ours. This is ours.
Right. We made this.

183
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:24,124
- What's our demographic?
- Every-fucking-one.

184
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,893
Yeah.

185
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,261
Thank you. You can go now.

186
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:29,997
Yeah, thank you.
It's a big opportunity, so...

187
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,501
- Right. Pitch me.
- Pitch me hard.

188
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:35,669
Schultz? So I was thinking
of something called...

189
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,905
the<i> "S'nuff</i> Guide
to Beating Off at Work."

190
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:40,807
Where to do it, how to do
it, how not to get caught.

191
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,509
How to get caught.
Makes it more fun, yeah.

192
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:47,180
I already started
the research, you guys.

193
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:48,848
- Bryson?
- Okay, I got one.

194
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,684
"You're Not Gay. She's Boring."

195
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:52,085
Good. Yeah?

196
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,920
- Fantastic. I can see it.
- Thank you.

197
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,688
Okay, I have another to pitch.

198
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,424
Maybe a cover, I don't know.

199
00:09:57,426 --> 00:10:00,460
Uh, "You Call Those Tits?"

200
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:02,262
That's good. Yeah.

201
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:05,198
And then, maybe, like, a "Where
Are They Now?" piece about, uh,

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,333
the kids Michael Jackson
gave settlements to.

203
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:08,501
Good. Ooh!

204
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,870
I wanna know.
That's good, yeah.

205
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:13,005
I play ice hockey with one of them.
I'll get an e-mail.

206
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,874
Yeah, that's good. Right.

207
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:18,644
So, assignments. Schultz, you're
on the Ryan Phillippe piece.

208
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:20,980
Oh, what? Yes!<i> Crash</i> was epic.

209
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:23,716
I was thinking I would take
a stab at the Phillippe piece.

210
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:26,553
No, no. Ryan, I tell you,
he's in a major funk right now,

211
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:30,856
and he will respond much better to a male
who is neither attractive nor masculine.

212
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,459
Blam! That's me right here.

213
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:36,061
Bryson, I've got a red mark by your name.
Why would that be?

214
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:39,632
Yes, okay. I am pitching
Dr. Aaron Conners.

215
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,300
Uh, he works with
some of the Knicks.

216
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:45,171
He's this incredible, young
sports physician on the rise,

217
00:10:45,173 --> 00:10:49,307
and he just created this revolutionary knee
insert that cuts recovery time in half.

218
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:51,510
He's about to perform it on
Amar'e Stoudemire.

219
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,845
It'll be the first time it's
ever been done on a pro athlete.

220
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,682
If we get this, we'll have access
to the biggest names in sports.

221
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,484
LeBron, Durant, Blake Griffin.

222
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:02,087
I've heard of this guy. He did
D'Brickashaw Ferguson's knee, right?

223
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:04,589
Yes. Yeah, and Metta
World Peace's too.

224
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,325
Yeah, Thabo Sefolosha owes
his whole career to this guy.

225
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,528
Are these real names?
What's that, Amy?

226
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,997
Your thoughts?
I'd... I'm sorry. I just...

227
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,001
I don't know why we treat
these athletes like heroes...

228
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:18,437
just 'cause they can skate fast
or kick a ball in a net.

229
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,072
I just think that it's weird.
No offense.

230
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:23,108
I just think that
sports are stupid...

231
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,714
and anyone who likes them is
just, like, a lesser person...

232
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,615
and has a small intellect.

233
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:37,188
Killer. I want you
to write the piece.

234
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,424
What? What?

235
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:42,126
Oh, no, no. I literally
can't stomach sports.

236
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:44,229
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Your opposition is perfection.

237
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:45,863
This really feels like
a Bryson article.

238
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,698
Yeah, this feels
like a "me" article.

239
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,734
- I pitched it.
- You pitched it. I'm giving it to Amy.

240
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,569
What are you saying? Giving me attitude?
I can do...

241
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,405
This isn't a fucking medical journal.
I can do opposition.

242
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,541
- I can do sexy.
- I want that.

243
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,543
I want that hatred.

244
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:01,579
I'm giving it to Amy. Don't sulk at me.
I'm not sulking. I'm...

245
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:05,350
This is my decision. I am
giving it to Amy. Sure. Fine.

246
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,453
I can do sexy though. Sorry?

247
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:09,720
Huh? What?

248
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:12,155
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- I'm just...

249
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:13,824
having fun.

250
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,593
Nikki, I want you to research...

251
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,163
whether garlic makes
semen taste any different.

252
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:24,500
Oh. Um, how am I supposed
to get the... Thank you.

253
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,536
You inspire me.

254
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:30,172
It tastes the same.

255
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:36,444
Amy. I'm not trying
to punish you.

256
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:38,146
Does it feel a little like I am?

257
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,947
Uh, no, no. I appreciate the...

258
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:43,150
Well, you know, I know you want
to branch out and cover more.

259
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:47,021
And you do know I'm looking for a
new executive editor, don't you?

260
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,956
I do know that,
and I'm very, very interested.

261
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,125
I'd love to be considered.

262
00:12:51,127 --> 00:12:54,261
Uh, especially... My dad's
house, like, isn't selling,

263
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:58,099
and my sister and I just had to put
him in this assisted living place.

264
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,905
And you would think it
was, like, the Waldorf.

265
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:00,634
It's so expensive.

266
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,717
Is this your one-woman show right now?
'Cause I ain't got a ticket.

267
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,375
You know,
just eviscerate the piece.

268
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,510
I'm giving you an assignment.
Right, yeah.

269
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:13,012
Hmm? And, Amy, if you would...

270
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:15,849
teach this about this.

271
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:23,789
So, does she have a foreign
accent, or is she just awesome?

272
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:28,339
Don't talk to me for two weeks.

273
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:33,799
<i>That's my sister, Kim.
She's cute, right?</i>

274
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:37,536
<i>Well, back off!
She's totally married as fuck.</i>

275
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:39,805
<i>Our dad's MS
has gotten really bad,</i>

276
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:41,673
<i>so he can't live
by himself anymore.</i>

277
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,976
<i>We're cleaning out his house.</i>

278
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:45,644
There's your box.

279
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,178
So that stuff's Goodwill,
that stuff's eBay,

280
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,746
and that stuff
up front is trash.

281
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:51,249
This is... This stuff's eBay?
Yeah.

282
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:54,018
We should go... I wanna go through this.
No, don't go through it.

283
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,887
That's stuff we can
make money off of.

284
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,823
Why are they here?

285
00:13:58,825 --> 00:14:01,025
They're picking me up.

286
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:03,194
Hey, Mother, look!
We got a croquet set.

287
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:05,596
Great job, sweet pea!

288
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:08,266
He calls you "Mother"? That's not creepy.
Yeah, it was his choice.

289
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:10,935
Have him call you "Stepmother."
It's more accurate.

290
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,605
- I've raised that child!
- Mom, I found a glove.

291
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:15,707
Hey, buddy. How you doing? Good.

292
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:17,775
What are you, uh,
studying in school?

293
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:21,713
I'm learning about space
and all the celestial objects,

294
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:24,716
and, you know, how there are
planets and solar systems...

295
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:28,087
and sometimes there could be,
you know, multiple universes,

296
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,889
but people don't know how to describe
that yet, but it's a new theory,

297
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:33,425
and I'm so excited to see
if they figured it out or not.

298
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,961
Great.

299
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,631
See you around.

300
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,366
Okay.

301
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,769
Why is he dressed
like Colonel Sanders?

302
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,804
He got to dress himself
and that's what he chose.

303
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,772
That's what the inside of his
heart looks like. Be nice.

304
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,541
Can you just be real
for a second?

305
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:53,210
I-If you just, like, met
that dude at, like, a CVS,

306
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:54,811
you'd have a real
problem with him.

307
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,513
Can you just pretend to like him?
I am pretending.

308
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,716
Ooh, I like Tom's sweater.

309
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:03,453
He's doing, like,
the<i> To Catch a Predator</i> look.

310
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:04,887
Amy! What?

311
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:06,989
Amy, what's up? Hey!

312
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:10,593
Looking sharp. Looking sharp, man.
Thanks.

313
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,261
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.

314
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,896
I was reading
your article about...

315
00:15:13,898 --> 00:15:15,430
how to talk your girlfriend
into a three-way.

316
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:16,964
You read that one? Yeah.

317
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,565
- Wow!
- Would you do that?

318
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,134
Nope. No.

319
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,503
Wow, that got off the table quick.
Yeah.

320
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,439
Let him do what he wants. You guys
should make a sex tape. - I would.

321
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,203
Uh... I did high school theater.
I think I'd be pretty good.

322
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,013
This nursing home is nice.

323
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,749
Yeah. It's too nice
and it's too expensive,

324
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:37,351
and we should've put him in a shithole.
No. We did.

325
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,953
No, I mean, it's a shithole.

326
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:41,755
It's just like
the nicest shithole. Yeah.

327
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:45,593
Places where the nurses don't
fuck the patients are expensive.

328
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:48,028
That's what you're paying for.
It's not the food, sister.

329
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,832
Ew! "Condoms ribbed
for his pleasure"?

330
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,134
Ew. I better hold on to these.

331
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,036
Is this coke? No.

332
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,372
Dad didn't love coke. He was
just a full-blown alcoholic.

333
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,975
No. It must just be from
like a Halloween costume.

334
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:04,509
Oh.

335
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Moving on.

336
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,880
Okay, let's just...
Amy, don't touch it.

337
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:11,281
These are his memories.

338
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,316
No, don't do that!

339
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:15,452
What? He needs his wallet.
Toss it away.

340
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,654
We've got so much stuff to go through.
Please sto...

341
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:19,723
Aw!

342
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:22,692
Oh! He loves that poster.
Oh, I know.

343
00:16:24,127 --> 00:16:26,395
Kimberly! Stop it!

344
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:29,131
Stop it! Girl, come on!

345
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:31,867
Not cool, girl. That felt good.

346
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,903
It's not right. Alaska.

347
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,171
No! Don't throw away
his snow globes.

348
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:39,874
These are his memories. He got
one of these everywhere he went.

349
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,767
Does he have one for every
one of our teachers?

350
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,476
I don't see them.

351
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:44,979
He didn't fuck all of our teachers.
He fucked all of my teachers.

352
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:47,715
No, he never fucked Mr. Hecht.

353
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,149
I did.

354
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,851
I'm just kidding.

355
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:54,487
You know, he wouldn't, but...
Where's that?

356
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,490
Mmm. Hamburg.

357
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:58,591
Auschwitz. What?

358
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,262
I guess they have a gift shop.
Hmm.

359
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:04,764
Oh, man.

360
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:06,766
Look at this.

361
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,505
Mom was so fuckable then.

362
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,042
She had the best tits.

363
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:18,844
When she would lay down,
they would just stay put.

364
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,880
Mine are just like, "See ya!"

365
00:17:20,882 --> 00:17:24,182
My titties are like, "Peace!"

366
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,786
Dad was such a dick.

367
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,125
Yeah, I don't really
see it that way.

368
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:47,571
Can we mix it up a little bit?
Will you talk dirty to me?

369
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,239
Come on. Uh, Amy, no.

370
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:51,242
Come on! Just...
It's not something I do well.

371
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:54,478
I'm not really verbal, okay? I'm
more physical in how I communicate.

372
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,090
You're gonna be great.
I'm gonna sound stupid.

373
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,048
I don't wanna sound stupid.

374
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,051
You're not gonna sound stupid. Clear your
mind and say whatever pops in it, okay?

375
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,554
Just try it. Just say anything.

376
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,290
All right.

377
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,958
I'm gonna give you
my full pecker.

378
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,727
Yeah. Okay.

379
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:12,464
'Cause of the pecs, but
pecker's kind of like my dick.

380
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,100
Yeah, y-yeah, I got it. I understood
what you meant by "pecker."

381
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,936
I'm gonna fill you with protein.

382
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:22,007
Yeah. I'm gonna give you the protein you
need to survive when you're making muscles.

383
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,575
I'm gonna put
my green drink in you.

384
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,979
Yeah, beta-carotene
and vegetable mix.

385
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,682
Can it not be about protein
or-or energy or nutrition?

386
00:18:30,684 --> 00:18:32,818
Can you just talk about
like sex stuff?

387
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:37,087
- All right.
- Yes, okay. Just sexy stuff.

388
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,823
Okay, here. All right.

389
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,524
Talk to me.

390
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:43,026
There's no "I" in "team."

391
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:45,195
But there's an "I" in "win."

392
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:49,599
Can't spell "victory"
without T-R-Y.

393
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,368
Winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

394
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,505
Okay. These are just phrases,
for, like, sports phrases.

395
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:57,807
Are these Nike slogans?
Please, just...

396
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,109
Do you want the "Just do it"?
Do you want that one? No!

397
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:02,612
Just have... Just have sex with
me and say some dirty shit.

398
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:09,785
What... Wha... What is that? Talking to you
dirty in Chinese. That's what I'm doing.

399
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:12,627
What? I've been studying
Mandarin in my off time.

400
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:15,123
"Do you need to go
to the bathroom?"

401
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,358
Please don't speak Chinese or
whatever during sex. Okay, I got it.

402
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,995
Okay, no problem. Just, yeah. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be so picky.

403
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:22,997
No, I... You look discouraged
and you're doing great.

404
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:24,999
I told you I wasn't gonna be
any good at this.

405
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,801
- Can we try something else?
- Yeah.

406
00:19:26,803 --> 00:19:29,403
Talk about...

407
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:31,839
the first time you saw me.

408
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:34,308
Okay?

409
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,009
That's easy. Yeah, right.

410
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:38,078
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
- Yeah?

411
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,146
I was just getting done in the gym.
Yeah?

412
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,548
You were leaving that pizza
place, remember? Yeah.

413
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah, and you were
holding on to that box.

414
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:46,218
Mm-hmm. And you walked out.

415
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,220
Yeah?
Oh! You were in those jeans.

416
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:51,591
- Oh, God! They looked so good from behind.
- Uh-huh?

417
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,326
Oh. From behind... Yeah?

418
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:54,860
Yeah? You looked like a dude!

419
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,896
- What?
- Oh!

420
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,530
Wha...

421
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:02,501
What?

422
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,935
Mm.

423
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,406
Don't move! Don't move!
Don't move at all!

424
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,529
Don't move at all! Anything! Ah!
You're moving your arm!

425
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:18,549
Fudge ripple ice cream! Ah!

426
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:24,554
Oh, yeah!

427
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,529
Oh. That was great.

428
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,430
We gotta make that part of our program.
For sure.

429
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,365
Really onto something.

430
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,731
Amy. Don't forget
to hydrate, babe.

431
00:20:51,747 --> 00:20:54,081
We went verbal!

432
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,317
The boys make the noise!

433
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,656
What's up, brother?
Yes, I'm loving it. Rastaman!

434
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,725
Digging it with the rolling bag.
Mixed messages.

435
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:07,160
Come back over here.
I love you on<i> Glee.</i>

436
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,563
How's it going?
Amy, what's happening?

437
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:13,600
You got a new sign? Yeah, you know,
I'm working a couple ideas out.

438
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:17,837
Yeah, I'm gonna visit my dad.
Oh. How is he?

439
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,173
Eh, we put him in an
assisted living facility.

440
00:21:20,175 --> 00:21:22,441
I don't know
how nice it is actually.

441
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:24,643
Hmm. I know exactly
how you feel.

442
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:28,113
The car I take a shit in,
they towed it.

443
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:29,447
Yeah. Sucks.

444
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:31,483
Sorry, man. All right,
I'll see you later.

445
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:33,084
I'll see you later.
I'll be here.

446
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:35,319
Hey, I'm digging that
back camel toe.

447
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,955
What a ridiculous statement.

448
00:21:37,957 --> 00:21:41,758
I mean, you're talking about the
most talented player on all levels.

449
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,661
None of these bums
are the equal of Babe Ruth.

450
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,430
- Norman, Babe Ruth was awful.
- Stop it.

451
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,131
How can you negate facts?

452
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,468
Just be nice to him. I am nice to him.
He's not nice to me.

453
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,839
Babe Ruth was a superhero.
He was Superman!

454
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:59,042
Easy to be a Superman when you never played
against a black guy your whole life.

455
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:02,446
What does white-black
got to do with it?

456
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:05,482
Every 12-year-old kid in the Dominican Republic
right now can probably beat Babe Ruth.

457
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:07,318
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

458
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,220
Before 1947, it's one big asterisk.
Blah!

459
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:14,325
Can you just keep a low profile
for like two weeks, here?

460
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:16,994
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't wanna
offend any of these people...

461
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:19,731
who, uh, fucking each other with
Viagra day and night, God forbid.

462
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:23,568
Can you just be nice and make friends?
After 7:00, after dinner,

463
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,137
it turns into<i> Caligula</i>
around here.

464
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,539
Trust me. Please, just...

465
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:30,174
It's a madhouse, like the Playboy
Mansion, for Christ's sakes.

466
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,710
This place? Yes.

467
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,646
You got my Mets stuff?

468
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,081
Yeah.

469
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:41,850
Amy. I'll bring it by.

470
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:43,185
Amy.

471
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:46,054
Look at me.

472
00:22:46,056 --> 00:22:47,588
Amy.

473
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,724
Kim made me throw
a lot of it away.

474
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:52,860
- Kim made you? Your little sister?
- Yes. She's mean as a dog.

475
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:55,663
- Jesus.
- I tried. I'm so sorry.

476
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,998
What do I care?
It's all memorabilia anyway.

477
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,701
I'm memorabilia at this point.

478
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,302
Don't say that.

479
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:20,120
Dr. Conners?

480
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:22,122
Hi. Hi. Hey. Hi.

481
00:23:22,124 --> 00:23:24,357
Amy Townsend.
Hi. Aaron Conners.

482
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,193
Great to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

483
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:28,795
Thank you so much for letting me come in.
No worries.

484
00:23:28,797 --> 00:23:31,965
Um, so... How does this work?

485
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:35,040
Oh, uh, today's really
just to go over schedules.

486
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:35,901
Oh, okay.

487
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:38,137
If that's cool.
Yeah, that's great.

488
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:41,440
Uh, I have never, uh,
been interviewed for a magazine.

489
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:42,941
Heya. Hey, LeBron.

490
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,977
I don't mean to interrupt.
Did I leave my sunglasses here?

491
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,579
I-I don't know. Did you?

492
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:50,282
You know, I was sitting...
Oh, here they are. Phew!

493
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:53,551
Did you just drive 40 minutes back
here to look for your sunglasses?

494
00:23:53,553 --> 00:23:56,454
Yeah, of course. You think I'm gonna
give Sunglass Hut another $30 for these?

495
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:58,389
You crazy? Hey, how you doing?

496
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:01,760
Hi! Wait, your watch costs
more than my apartment.

497
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,629
Oh, this thing? Oh. Oh, that was a gift.
We watching<i> Downtown Abbey</i> later?

498
00:24:04,631 --> 00:24:06,897
Uh, if I get outta here on time.
Yeah, we could watch it.

499
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:08,900
If not, let's do it tomorrow.
What?

500
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:11,435
Listen, I'm watching it tonight, 'cause I'm
not gonna go to practice in the morning,

501
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:13,738
and all the guys are talking
about it and I'm left out.

502
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,639
Well, hey, do what you gotta do.
All right.

503
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:17,273
Can you, uh, validate
my parking, please?

504
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:19,576
I don't validate.
You should talk to Cheryl.

505
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,144
Okay. All right, take care.
Nice meeting you.

506
00:24:21,146 --> 00:24:22,979
Bye, LeBron. Thanks, buddy.
Okay.

507
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,649
Cheryl, can you
validate my parking, please?

508
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:27,917
Tall. Yeah, I know, right?

509
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,518
Do you know who that was?

510
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,521
The basketball player.

511
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:35,590
He's LeBron James. He's kind
of like <i>the</i> basketball player.

512
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:38,427
Oh, yeah. I think I saw one of
his soda commercials. Yeah.

513
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,429
You follow sports?

514
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,998
Oh, my God. Sports?

515
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,134
I love them.
Who are your favorite teams?

516
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:46,768
The, uh...

517
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,369
I like smaller teams,
like the...

518
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,805
Not the big leagues.
I like the, like, uh,

519
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:53,541
Long Island Mediums.

520
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:56,611
The-The Acorn Pinecones.

521
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,480
I haven't heard of them.
The Fire Island Penguins.

522
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:02,484
I like the Cincinnati Thunder-Wizards.
You can stop.

523
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,886
The Orlando...

524
00:25:04,888 --> 00:25:06,721
Blooms. You can stop.

525
00:25:06,723 --> 00:25:08,990
You... You don't follow sports.

526
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:11,292
I... I'm sorry. I don't.

527
00:25:11,294 --> 00:25:13,194
I don't know anything about sports.
You know what?

528
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:15,229
That's okay though. Don't be embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

529
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:18,465
No, don't be embarrassed, because I didn't
really follow sports until I got this job.

530
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,134
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

531
00:25:20,136 --> 00:25:23,303
Oh, my God. You have no idea
what a huge relief that is.

532
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:26,674
I-I... I was assigned this.
This was not even my pitch.

533
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:29,910
- Right. So you're doing the article on me?
- Mm-hmm.

534
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:31,512
Awesome.

535
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:34,548
I think they're kind of weird
and just-just... strange.

536
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,685
Grown men wearing jerseys
with another man's name on it.

537
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,687
Like, are you in jail?
Are you his bitch?

538
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:41,255
Right. Kind of like that one?

539
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:50,264
That's different,
'cause it's in a frame.

540
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:52,266
I think sports brings
people together, you know.

541
00:25:52,268 --> 00:25:53,700
It kind of forms a community.

542
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:56,236
That's what I'm saying.
Right. Yeah. Obviously.

543
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,371
I'll tell you another thing
that's great about this job...

544
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,606
is that I get to work with
athletes, which means that I, uh...

545
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:01,908
I work with a lot of, um,

546
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,242
Black people? Injuries...

547
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,244
What did you just say?
Did you say, "black people"?

548
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:07,613
No.

549
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:09,381
Do you have a problem
with black people?

550
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:12,250
No. I love black people.
I prefer black people.

551
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:15,787
- Do you have black friends?
- Endless black friends.

552
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:18,556
Can you show me pictures of your
black friends on your phone?

553
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,127
You... You want to see pictures
on my phone of my black friends?

554
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:24,195
Amy, you gotta have
a lot of them.

555
00:26:24,197 --> 00:26:26,932
I have so many. I'm just deciding which
one, 'cause there's, like, so many.

556
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,800
Oh! Here we go.
Oh, great. Let's see.

557
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:30,701
So, you're gonna be eating your words.
Oh, good.

558
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:31,903
You ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

559
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:33,571
Okay, get ready.

560
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:35,272
Black friend!

561
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,376
That is you and a white friend.

562
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:41,245
And that is a black waiter
pouring your water.

563
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:44,115
Let me find another one.
Oh. My phone died.

564
00:26:44,117 --> 00:26:47,043
Um, I'm gonna let you
get back to doctoring.

565
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,084
Oh, thanks.

566
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,886
- I'll talk to your...
- Cheryl.

567
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:51,120
Cheryl. Yeah.

568
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:54,556
About, um, when we can meet again.
Great.

569
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,701
<i>No, we're not going
into the park.</i>

570
00:27:08,471 --> 00:27:10,505
<i>We've been in the park already.</i>

571
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:11,906
Ooh.

572
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,508
Sorry I'm late.

573
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,643
No, it's okay.
It's a wonderful film.

574
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:17,311
Daniel Radcliffe is in it.
Mm-hmm.

575
00:27:17,313 --> 00:27:19,347
Yeah.<i> Dog...</i> What is the movie?

576
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:22,917
Radcliffe is a dog walker, but he's got
a chip on his shoulder, a real edge.

577
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,485
Sundance loved it!

578
00:27:24,487 --> 00:27:27,255
<i>I need help with my dog.</i>

579
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:30,291
<i>I can see that.</i>

580
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:32,927
<i>I would love to be the one
to help you with your dog.</i>

581
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,629
<i>What's your technique?</i>

582
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:38,666
<i>Well, I put them
on a leash and walk them.</i>

583
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:40,701
<i>You talk a big game.</i>

584
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:45,473
<i>That's 'cause I walk a big dog.</i>

585
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:47,508
<i>She's looks little,</i>

586
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,144
Amy. <i>But she's not.</i>

587
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:52,846
What's up?
Is that wine in a box?

588
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:54,347
Mm-hmm.

589
00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:56,383
- I have red too.
- You have red too?

590
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,184
What the fuck? Is this guy
ever gonna shut up?

591
00:27:58,186 --> 00:28:01,121
Mm, please watch the movie.

592
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,356
Whoa. Stop. No, that's not right.
Don't do this to me.

593
00:28:03,358 --> 00:28:05,224
Why is he yelling?

594
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:06,960
Listen, you always
do this to me.

595
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:09,395
You show up to these places,
you put me in a situation.

596
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:11,897
I'm a big guy. Everybody wants to
fight the big guy. Yeah, you are.

597
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,300
Hey, uh, Mark Wahlberg,
shut your bitch up.

598
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,303
Mark... Mark Wahlberg?
Are you gonna...

599
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:20,840
Me? Who else looks like Mark Wahlberg?
Your girl?

600
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:22,842
Mark Wahlberg's like
a hundred and fifty pounds.

601
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:25,178
I'm 250, lean.

602
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,580
I look like Mark Wahlberg
<i>ate</i> Mark Wahlberg!

603
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,815
Your muscles aren't the fucking problem.
Do you even lift?

604
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:31,350
It's your yapping girlfriend.

605
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:32,551
Just say, "Fuck you."

606
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:33,852
Yeah. Yes.

607
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:35,987
I will fuck you! All right?
I will enter you!

608
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,657
You're gonna...
You're gonna "enter" me?

609
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,326
- Did you hear what he said?
- What are you talking about right now?

610
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:42,895
I'm just trying
to intimidate him.

611
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:44,563
You're just talking
about raping him.

612
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,731
You're not about that life, champ.
I can see it.

613
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,432
I am about that life!
No, you're not.

614
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,102
You just like to flex your muscles.
I will get crazy up in here.

615
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,870
You like movies? We'll make a movie.
Oh, God.

616
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:54,538
We'll make
"Mama Say Knock You Out,"

617
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,507
starring my fist
and your dick hole.

618
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:59,069
Oh, shit! What the fuck
is wrong with this dude?

619
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,010
He wants you.

620
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:02,279
Babe, your threats, I'm telling
you, they're super gay.

621
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,780
Too sexual? Yeah.

622
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:06,582
This has to be the corniest,
muscled white dude...

623
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:08,251
I've ever seen
in my fucking life.

624
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:11,086
Okay, Koko B. Ware.
You know what?

625
00:29:11,088 --> 00:29:12,587
You're being an asshole,
all right?

626
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,756
You know what I do with assholes?
I lick 'em. Okay.

627
00:29:14,758 --> 00:29:16,791
Uh, what the fuck?
He wants to fuck you.

628
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:17,953
Okay?

629
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:29,438
<i>My pooch has been hurt
more than enough.</i>

630
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,609
<i>I will make sure no one ever
hurts your pooch again.</i>

631
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:37,313
<i>I like when you're taking
control of your dogs.</i>

632
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,715
<i>I thought you would.</i>

633
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:42,050
Oh, my God.

634
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,389
What'd I miss?
Amy, what did I miss?

635
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:49,425
<i>I want to paddle real hard.</i>

636
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:51,593
They pre-butter it.

637
00:29:51,595 --> 00:29:53,060
Who's Brody?

638
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:56,330
What?

639
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,765
Who's... Who's Oli? Who's Brody?

640
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,068
Why you my have cell phone?

641
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,736
Why are you smiling?

642
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:06,773
I got a little high outside.
Like, barely at all high.

643
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,841
Okay. While you were
outside getting high,

644
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:11,009
I was putting your phone
on silent for the movie.

645
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:13,779
When I did that, I noticed you
have all these guys in your phone.

646
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:15,614
There's Brody. This guy is
listed as "Hot as Balls."

647
00:30:15,616 --> 00:30:17,649
Who the fuck is "Hot as Balls"?

648
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:20,319
Stop smiling! I'm not smiling.
Those are guys from work.

649
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,020
Oh.

650
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:23,588
Can we just watch this movie?

651
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,490
You know what? No, I can't.

652
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,292
Because as I was turning off your phone,
I got a picture of somebody's dick.

653
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,027
It was mine.

654
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,863
You know, fuck you, Tone Loc.

655
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,831
You want to take it to
the parking lot? Fine!

656
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,834
You can't find me? I'll be
the closest one on Grindr.

657
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,370
That's gay.

658
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:44,007
Steven, please.
I am not in shape for this.

659
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,175
Stop walking like the Hulk!
I can see that you're mad.

660
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,343
You're being crazy. Am I?

661
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:50,112
'Cause I think you owe me
an explanation for this.

662
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,114
Do I have to worry about you
with other guys?

663
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,817
I'm so high right now. Can we just
please talk about this tomorrow?

664
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,819
I'm too fucked up.
Amy, you're always fucked up.

665
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,854
Answer the question.

666
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:01,490
Are you hooking up
with other guys?

667
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,325
We never said we were exclusive.

668
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,194
Fuck, Amy! "Exclusive"?
It's not high school.

669
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:10,499
You know, every single guy I work
out with, every single guy...

670
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,636
says that all you're gonna do is
mess with my emotions and hurt me.

671
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,571
You guys talk about
that at the gym?

672
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:19,215
Fuck, Amy. Do I have to worry
about you with other guys?

673
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:24,545
Yes, I hook up with other guys.

674
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:29,049
I don't go to the
movies with them.

675
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:30,718
That's like our special thing.

676
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,021
This is so fucking stupid.
You know what the sad part is?

677
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,225
I was gonna ask you
to marry me.

678
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,860
Really?

679
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:44,363
I didn't even think
you liked me very much.

680
00:31:44,365 --> 00:31:46,365
Why are you making me
feel bad about this?

681
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,836
You can sleep with other girls.
It's like every guy's dream.

682
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:52,038
It's not this guy's dream.

683
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,373
Yeah, this guy's got a dream,

684
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:57,944
and it's us, making it.

685
00:31:57,946 --> 00:32:01,181
Getting married, moving out to the
countryside, having a family.

686
00:32:01,183 --> 00:32:03,516
Three boys and two more boys.

687
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:06,051
Enough for a basketball team.
Why?

688
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:08,888
And I'll develop a CrossFit
program and patent it.

689
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,191
And I'll rule
the CrossFit world...

690
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:14,561
with you by my side.

691
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:17,463
You can be my CrossFit queen.

692
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,098
That's my dream.

693
00:32:26,473 --> 00:32:27,806
Hey.

694
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,474
Hey.

695
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:36,079
Can I leave?

696
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,148
Or, like, can you leave?

697
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,620
I just like... I'm very high, and I just
kind of need this interaction to be over.

698
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:45,655
You serious?

699
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:48,224
Fuck you, Amy.
You are not nice.

700
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,464
I'm totally nice.

701
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,470
Maybe you should...

702
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:03,140
consider changing your ways.

703
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,609
My "ways"? Mm-hmm.

704
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,745
You would love having a family.

705
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:10,147
You sound like Steven. I wish
I could break up with you.

706
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:11,982
Having a family is fun.

707
00:33:11,984 --> 00:33:13,586
That's fun? Yeah.

708
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:17,020
They're having a boys' lunch.
Here?

709
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:18,956
Hi! Hi, ladies.

710
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,158
Um, I really like your hair.

711
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,993
Is that choice,
or you, like did it?

712
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:25,596
No, it's just my deal.
I'm bald. So... Oh.

713
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:27,631
Cool. It's like...
You look like Bruce Willis.

714
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,099
Like early Willis. Totally.

715
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:30,533
Thanks.

716
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:33,270
Um, You know what?
We will have two mimosas.

717
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,171
Okay? Mm-mmm.

718
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,674
No, you're right. Hold the orange juice.
No orange juice.

719
00:33:37,676 --> 00:33:40,376
It's sugar. So, champagne?

720
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:42,812
Oh. Okay.

721
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,547
No, no. No champagne for me.

722
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:46,782
Uh, yeah, we'll have
two champagnes.

723
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:50,620
Two champagnes. Thanks. Okay.
We'll see you in a bit.

724
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:53,356
Oh, my God. He's, like,
dying to fuck me. Mm-hmm.

725
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:56,859
Wait, why aren't you drinking?
Have a drink with me.

726
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,894
Wait.

727
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:00,128
No!

728
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,965
You're pregnant? I'm pregnant!

729
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:05,667
God!

730
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,336
Tom's the father.

731
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,770
Ew!

732
00:34:11,473 --> 00:34:13,708
God. They look like
they're on a speed date.

733
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,476
Say, "Congratulations."

734
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,978
We're telling Dad.

735
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,341
I'll tell him at the new nursing home.
The one that's cheaper.

736
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:24,752
It's not okay.
You're telling him.

737
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:27,387
Kim, are you serious?

738
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:29,322
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

739
00:34:29,324 --> 00:34:31,658
You're pregnant.

740
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,060
Oh, my God.
Come here. Come here.

741
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:35,694
Oh!

742
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:38,764
My God. Oh, my God!

743
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,732
I'm tingling right now.
I feel high.

744
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:42,400
I feel high!

745
00:34:42,402 --> 00:34:44,770
- That's incredible.
- Thank you.

746
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:47,239
I'm finally gonna be
a grandfather.

747
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,542
You're already a grandfather.

748
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:52,244
- But not yet.
- No. You were already a grandfather.

749
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:54,079
Allister, Dad. What's that?

750
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:55,181
Allister. What about him?

751
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:56,549
That's your grandson.

752
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:58,517
Allister?

753
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,888
No, I mean, Allister's...
your stepchild...

754
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,789
and my step-grandkid, I guess.

755
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:08,216
But I'm talking about <i>your</i> kid.
Our bloodlines.

756
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:09,226
That's... Yeah.

757
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:12,630
I was the first person on my
block to own a television set.

758
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:14,531
That's... That's really not
relevant right now, Norman.

759
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,099
That's interest...
It's not relevant.

760
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,600
Come on, that's more
like Tom's kid.

761
00:35:17,602 --> 00:35:20,236
It's Tom's kid,
who you help with.

762
00:35:20,238 --> 00:35:21,870
Dad, you love Allister.

763
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:25,741
I like Allister. I care for him.
I fear for him.

764
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:28,121
I know what happens to a kid
like that in the school yard.

765
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:29,411
We had a kid like that. Stewie.

766
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:32,081
We used to beat him mercilessly.

767
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:34,817
Oh! Some of the beatings
I almost feel bad about.

768
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:36,953
That's gonna happen to this kid.
He's perfectly...

769
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:38,988
I'm trying to protect him,
teach him to be a man.

770
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,290
I don't know what you're talking about.
You were the worst father ever.

771
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:44,394
Come on. I wasn't a bad father.

772
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:45,962
Mom did everything
when we were growing up.

773
00:35:45,964 --> 00:35:47,563
You wouldn't understand
'cause you weren't there.

774
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,632
So now your mother's a saint?
Of course she's a saint.

775
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:51,734
Of course. Because once you...
you die, everybody's a saint.

776
00:35:51,736 --> 00:35:53,435
Dad, just shut up.

777
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,604
We were just talking about
this yesterday, right?

778
00:35:55,606 --> 00:35:56,805
- About Allister.
- Amy?

779
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:58,239
No! He's... He's lying.

780
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,575
Amy? Amy, come on.

781
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:04,579
You said he's the kind of kid who drops his
pants to the floor when he pees in the urinal.

782
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:06,648
No, I didn't say that. You said that!
That's funny to guys.

783
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,083
I said he pees sitting down.

784
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,918
- Like, it was a joke...
- That was funny.

785
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,855
I cannot believe that you guys
are teaming up against me again.

786
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:16,023
Oh, my... No. I am on your side.

787
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:18,191
- I'm on your team.
- You're not on my team.

788
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:20,761
Sorry if I'm excited more about my
grandkid than some step-grandkid.

789
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:23,764
They're both your grandkid.
Goddamn it!

790
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:25,866
What the... Kimberly, come...

791
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,869
Is that your wife?

792
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,375
What is this speech you have to
make for Doctors With Borders?

793
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:40,846
"Without." Without Borders. It's
"Doctors Without Borders." Oh, right.

794
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:44,217
Yeah, no, it's Doctors Without Borders.
It's really a good organization.

795
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:47,720
Uh, basically, we go to places
with the most conflict,

796
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:51,658
places with the biggest disasters
and we go in and help people.

797
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,729
So, you help people by choice, and
that's, like, what you like? Yeah.

798
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,330
It's great work.

799
00:36:57,332 --> 00:36:59,492
It's very rewarding,
helping these people.

800
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:00,032
Wow!

801
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:02,635
What's your story? Are you like a
Division I athlete or something?

802
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,870
No! Me? No, no.

803
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:10,008
I was on the Xbox that I was playing and then
I got really high and tripped on my bong.

804
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,812
Are you high? Yeah.

805
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,549
Wow. So high.

806
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,818
I think I got your new article right here.
Here we go.

807
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,586
All right.

808
00:37:21,588 --> 00:37:25,357
So, uh, this is our Sports Medicine
and Performance Center. Wow.

809
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,360
This is where most of our athletes
come and, uh, do the rehabilitation.

810
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:29,994
What does this do?

811
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:32,230
Come on.

812
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:36,901
So the HBM, uh, shows how your
muscles are working and moving,

813
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:39,436
so your rehab's most effective.

814
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:41,771
Um, it could help you
with your gait, your posture.

815
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,241
- My gait?
- Mm-hmm.

816
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:46,610
Okay. So, you, let's say, just
walk normal for a second.

817
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:48,746
- That looks pretty good.
- Okay, okay.

818
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,914
Just... Just walk naturally for
one second, please. Okay.

819
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,916
That's it exa... Like this?

820
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:55,637
I walk like Beyoncé. People
always think I'm her.

821
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:56,887
We share on Instagram.

822
00:37:56,889 --> 00:37:58,649
This is how you walk down the street?
Mm-hmm.

823
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,858
No, this is how I walk.

824
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,227
I think the screen's doing different
stuff than what I'm doing.

825
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:06,730
What we can do with this,
is we could show how you can,

826
00:38:06,732 --> 00:38:10,366
um, fix your posture
and your gait.

827
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,802
I really wouldn't do
a Hitler march.

828
00:38:12,804 --> 00:38:16,438
Just walk the way you walk,
uh, down the street.

829
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,306
Is that... Is that... Like this?

830
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:24,979
All right. Sorry. I'm listening.
Okay? We good?

831
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,780
Yeah, I'm listening. You good?
All right. Thank you.

832
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,983
Wait, who is this? Ready? Watch the screen.
Who is this? - Okay.

833
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:36,558
Who? Kevin Spacey at the
end of<i> Usual Suspects.</i>

834
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,294
I didn't see that movie.
Oh. He's Keyser Söze.

835
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:41,429
That's not important.
It's not a spoiler. Oh.

836
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:44,232
So why don't you pick up the
speed a little bit? That's good.

837
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,101
That's good. Get a nice
jog going there. Okay.

838
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:48,803
That's good.

839
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,771
You can speed up
a bit faster, if you want.

840
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:54,675
Ah. There you go. See how that's
working out? That's great.

841
00:38:54,677 --> 00:38:56,777
See how your legs are lighting up green?
That's great.

842
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:58,645
You can go
a little faster actually.

843
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:01,081
Yeah, so don't lean forward
like that when you run.

844
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,450
You wanna lean back a little bit.
See how that's lighting up green?

845
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:05,492
There you go.
See, that's real nice.

846
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:09,021
See how you're...
you're landing on your heel.

847
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,990
You're stepping too far back. So you
wanna land on the ball of your foot.

848
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:14,994
There you go.
See, that's real nice.

849
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:18,197
Okay. How do you stop? Can you,
uh, make sure this thing stops?

850
00:39:20,168 --> 00:39:21,967
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

851
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:23,468
You all right? Uh-huh.

852
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,471
You're hyperventilating. Here.
Yeah. Can you get this off?

853
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,539
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You're fine. Okay. Okay.

854
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,641
- Look at me.
- Deep breath in.

855
00:39:29,643 --> 00:39:31,810
Blow it out like you're
blowing out a birthday candle.

856
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,481
That's good, that's good.
Slow it down. Slow it down.

857
00:39:36,483 --> 00:39:39,484
You're just hyperventilating.
You're all right.

858
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:42,688
You're okay.
Just take your time.

859
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,123
You all right?

860
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:47,692
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, okay.

861
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,961
- I haven't eaten much today.
- Oh, okay.

862
00:39:49,963 --> 00:39:52,977
I had like... Basically,
like, Lay's potato chips.

863
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:53,731
Oh.

864
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:57,368
Like... Stopped in Starbucks,
had, like one red velvet...

865
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,372
like, yogurt.

866
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:04,209
And, like, two scones
and they were, like super small.

867
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:07,479
And then just some Chipotle, but that
stuff, you know, like, runs through you.

868
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:09,647
So you had breakfast,
lunch and a snack?

869
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:11,315
Yeah, that's it. Okay.

870
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:13,484
Well, let's go get some food.
Yeah.

871
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:15,619
Yeah? Let's do that. Yeah.

872
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,869
Um, my dad, um,

873
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:33,071
is a rheumatologist,

874
00:40:33,073 --> 00:40:35,239
and my mom is
a college professor.

875
00:40:35,241 --> 00:40:37,375
They're great. They put a
lot of pressure on me.

876
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:39,343
I was their only child, so...

877
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:41,545
Or maybe they didn't put
a lot of pressure on me.

878
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:44,682
I just put the pressure on myself 'cause
they did so much great stuff, but...

879
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,717
No, they put pressure on me.
Let's not put...

880
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:48,920
Can we not put this in the article?
Is that all right?

881
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:51,956
This doesn't need to be in the article.
I don't know why I'm saying any of it.

882
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,191
They're great. They're great.
They're great.

883
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:55,633
Aaron's parents are great.
They sound great.

884
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:56,561
"Aaron's parents are great."

885
00:40:56,563 --> 00:40:59,564
I won't put any of that in
the article, if you don't want.

886
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,033
Is that all right? Yeah.

887
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:03,035
- Just off the record.
- Okay.

888
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:06,706
Um, just so you know, if you want me to,
uh, keep something out of the article,

889
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:09,475
if you want it to be off the record,
you have to tell me<i> before.</i>

890
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:12,445
Oh, really? Yeah. Uh,
this can be retroactive.

891
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:15,147
I won't put your parents in
the article, but... Okay.

892
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:19,718
Thanks.
This article is gonna be killer.

893
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,488
Yeah, it's gonna be a bummer.

894
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,724
Um... Hey, you know,
I read some of your stuff.

895
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:27,292
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

896
00:41:27,294 --> 00:41:29,394
They were really good. No.

897
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:32,331
When I started reading, it was one
thing, and I was like, "I don't know."

898
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,599
Then I started reading it
and I thought it was... I was...

899
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:37,269
"Oh, this is actually really funny
and smart." It's satirical.

900
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:40,572
- Thank you.
- It was... It was good.

901
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:43,175
I have other stuff that
I've written for other places.

902
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:45,577
That's the kind of stuff
they want at this magazine.

903
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:48,079
Can I read some of it?

904
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:51,149
Uh, yeah, you can read...
you can read some of my stuff.

905
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:54,852
- Do you wanna go get a drink?
- Yeah.

906
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:56,186
Yeah? Okay.

907
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:01,992
Can I get the check, please?
They... He understood.

908
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:04,461
Don't do it... Don't do
the symbol and yell.

909
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:06,297
Just... You do one or the other.

910
00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:07,998
What do you mean?

911
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,433
You can mouth the word "check"
really loud and not make noise.

912
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:12,101
And that's, like,
kind of the best.

913
00:42:12,103 --> 00:42:14,064
Well, what do I do? Watch.

914
00:42:14,538 --> 00:42:16,939
Check.

915
00:42:16,941 --> 00:42:18,942
Okay, let me try. Okay.

916
00:42:18,944 --> 00:42:21,311
- Check!
- No! No.

917
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:22,945
No.

918
00:42:22,947 --> 00:42:24,714
Am I not doing that right? No!

919
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:26,549
Check! Oh, my God!

920
00:42:26,551 --> 00:42:28,951
Could we get the bill, please?
We'd like to pay for the food!

921
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:41,030
Okay, first kiss. This girl
named Jennifer Jennifer.

922
00:42:41,032 --> 00:42:42,699
Her name was Jennifer Jennifer?

923
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:45,068
Her name was Jennifer Jennifer,
and she was very cute.

924
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,236
It was... It was a Halloween
party, seventh grade.

925
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:50,139
She was shorter than me. She had
to stand up on a stone to kiss me.

926
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:52,474
It was... It was like
a Norman Rockwell painting.

927
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:54,743
It was very cute. Oh! And
you see these teeth? Yeah.

928
00:42:54,745 --> 00:42:57,212
Oh. Look at these teeth.

929
00:42:57,214 --> 00:42:59,147
What's wrong? They're fake.
They're porcelain.

930
00:42:59,149 --> 00:43:02,484
Ron Gardner, seventh grade.

931
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:06,087
I got brand-new Air Jordans.
He wanted them. Yeah?

932
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:09,858
He punched me in the face and knocked
out my teeth and stole my shoes.

933
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,759
No! You're getting a
lot of info for me.

934
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:13,728
Ron Gardner! This is all
of the record, by the way.

935
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,563
All off the record. Oh, yeah,
off the record. Totally.

936
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:18,065
Hey, today was really fun.
Yeah, it was great.

937
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,700
I was a little nervous about it.
Yeah.

938
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:22,369
But no, this was a lot of fun.
No, this was great.

939
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:25,873
Um, if you wanna, like, maybe
come by tomorrow or... You coming?

940
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,741
Oh, you going downtown? Mm-hmm.

941
00:43:27,743 --> 00:43:30,043
Sweet. Uh, and...

942
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:33,047
Hi. Sorry.

943
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:36,884
Uh, two stops.
Uh, just one stop.

944
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:39,953
You wanna give him
your address?

945
00:43:39,955 --> 00:43:42,021
Sp... Spring and Washington.

946
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:57,604
Great. So, this
is where I live.

947
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,973
Uh, it's pretty sweet.

948
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:03,043
Um, do you want a drink or anything?
No, thanks.

949
00:44:03,045 --> 00:44:07,614
No? All right.
Um, this is the kitchen.

950
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:11,984
Um, it's a pretty sweet place.
I've been here for about a year.

951
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:16,288
Uh, you know what? Let's get
some tunes on in this place.

952
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:20,393
Holy shit. Hi. Hi.

953
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:31,839
So we're gonna do this now?
We are gonna do this now.

954
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:33,507
Okay, that's...

955
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:35,942
Is that okay?
That's cool, yeah.

956
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:38,845
Whoa! Ooh. All right.

957
00:44:41,114 --> 00:44:43,182
Do you own this place?
Are you renting it?

958
00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:45,450
I, uh... I own it.
Oh, cool. That's really nice.

959
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:47,051
Yeah, yeah.

960
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:52,289
You wanna g-go...

961
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,091
Oh, shit. Yeah.

962
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:56,693
Oh, we're doing this, like, right now?
We are doing this right now.

963
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,128
Wow, we are off to the races.
It's happening.

964
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,332
Oh, okay. All right.
That's nice.

965
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:07,771
Oh! Oh, man. Oh, God!

966
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:11,541
Oh, my God! Wow, good for you.
Yeah, oh, thank you.

967
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,210
This is... I didn't
see this for you.

968
00:45:13,212 --> 00:45:14,644
Yeah? Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm.

969
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,545
Mm! Mm.

970
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,715
Oh.

971
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:27,055
Okay. I'm, uh...
I'm gonna head out.

972
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,356
Oh, no. No.

973
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,225
Hey. Thank you. Oh.

974
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,193
That's... Yeah, why don't
you stay over?

975
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:34,828
Uh, yes, no.
I'm not gonna stay here.

976
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,198
I just... I...
You have an early day, I bet.

977
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,833
Oh, no, it's fine. Mmm.

978
00:45:52,747 --> 00:45:55,149
You comfortable?
No. No, I'm not.

979
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:57,217
Okay. This is... I don't
really like to spoon.

980
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:00,754
Oh. Okay. Yeah, just sorry.

981
00:46:00,756 --> 00:46:04,523
C-Can we, uh... If I stay here, can we
just sleep in a realistic position?

982
00:46:04,525 --> 00:46:06,726
Because it just... Sure, yeah.

983
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:09,929
I'm a light sleeper,
and I, like... I-I...

984
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:13,199
If I feel you move or, like, sweat
or breathe, I'll, like, wake up,

985
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:16,335
and I'll just, like, lay here
resenting you all night. Okay.

986
00:46:16,337 --> 00:46:19,672
Can we... Actually, could we put
this pillow in between us?

987
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:21,774
That'll be good, if we put this...
Put the pillow between us?

988
00:46:21,776 --> 00:46:24,577
Yeah, that's not, like, your
main pillow that you use, is it?

989
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:26,078
No. Okay, cool.

990
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,280
Yeah, let's just...
Let's kind of get that in there.

991
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:30,583
Thank you. Okay.

992
00:46:30,585 --> 00:46:31,917
Yeah.

993
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:38,891
I'm sorry I'm nitpicking, but, like, you're
breathing on me pretty hard right now.

994
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:41,727
Yeah, it's like a strong wind. Oh, okay.
What do you need me to do?

995
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:45,231
Breathe up towards the sky and
not, like, at me. Yeah. Okay.

996
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:48,602
Sorry, it's just... It's a lot.
Yeah, you got it. You got it.

997
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:51,304
Like this? Are you just...
Are you feeling better?

998
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:53,130
Is this more comfortable?
Let me see. Do it.

999
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:54,453
I'll tell you if I can feel it.

1000
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:00,447
I'm still getting, like, a
little bit of a wind. Oh, Jesus.

1001
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,049
Do you want me to go home? I can
still sleep at home. No, no.

1002
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:05,517
This is... This is so worth it.

1003
00:47:08,288 --> 00:47:11,456
Nikki, just hurry up
and get here.

1004
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:14,293
When you're writing an article, do
you always use a tape recorder?

1005
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:15,794
No.

1006
00:47:15,796 --> 00:47:17,930
Um, wh-when you're
writing an article,

1007
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:20,499
what are the 10 biggest
mistakes you could make?

1008
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:24,570
Um, plagiarizing, getting
drunk, fucking someone.

1009
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:27,139
Hey. Have you ever seen
any kind of article...

1010
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:30,776
about a fetish where guys like
to masturbate to hockey fights?

1011
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:32,344
That's not a thing.
Not a thing.

1012
00:47:32,346 --> 00:47:34,913
Then why'd it work for me?

1013
00:47:34,915 --> 00:47:37,850
- We're in the middle of something, so...
- Yeah. Seriously, right?

1014
00:47:41,188 --> 00:47:44,190
Okay. So, that actually brings me to
an interesting line of questioning.

1015
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:46,792
You know what?
Uh, they're gonna want you...

1016
00:47:46,794 --> 00:47:48,961
to just do a bunch of Web stuff
because you're younger.

1017
00:47:48,963 --> 00:47:51,363
Everyone has, like, a boner for young
people and the Internet, okay?

1018
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:53,365
They think you have, like,
the key to it. Amy!

1019
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:55,250
That's why we'll do anything
we can to help you here.

1020
00:47:55,276 --> 00:47:56,435
Right, but when
you're writing...

1021
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:58,136
I'm sorry. Just talk
to me about it later.

1022
00:47:58,138 --> 00:48:01,340
Just write them all down.
I'll be helpful later.

1023
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:02,674
Okay.

1024
00:48:02,676 --> 00:48:05,309
I like you, Amy.
I do, you know.

1025
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:07,478
You're clever,
but you're not too brainy.

1026
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,447
You're pretty-ish and you're not gorgeous.
You're approachable.

1027
00:48:10,449 --> 00:48:12,149
Thank you. Yeah.

1028
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:14,351
I want this promotion for
you, Amy, you know? Yeah.

1029
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,119
I want you to help me
to help you.

1030
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:17,988
I need to go up there,
to the men upstairs.

1031
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,457
I need you to provide me
with the<i> ammo...</i> Yeah.

1032
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:23,026
To get them to know that you
can handle their workload.

1033
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:25,062
Can you handle their load, Amy?

1034
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:27,730
I can handle all their loads.
That's it.

1035
00:48:30,634 --> 00:48:32,568
- Nikki.
- Hey.

1036
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,836
Where have you been? Oh. Sorry.
I was getting a smoothie.

1037
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:37,239
Can you just... Please, sit?

1038
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:39,674
I slept at the doctor's
place last night.

1039
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:41,910
Oh my God, 'cause you were,
like, blackout drunk? No.

1040
00:48:41,912 --> 00:48:44,412
That's the thing.
I-I was dead sober.

1041
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:47,214
I had, like, two drinks.
Three, max.

1042
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,650
Four, now that I'm tallying.
But it was like... I was sober.

1043
00:48:49,652 --> 00:48:52,185
Okay, so you... so you barely drank?
Barely.

1044
00:48:52,187 --> 00:48:54,021
'Cause you're on antibiotics
or something? No.

1045
00:48:54,023 --> 00:48:55,555
I spent the night on purpose.

1046
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,590
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand.

1047
00:48:57,592 --> 00:49:01,394
When you think about the sex,
are you just kinda like...

1048
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,396
No. I'm like...

1049
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:09,769
So, you're like...

1050
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:11,670
No, that's not what I'm doing.

1051
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:13,873
You're...

1052
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,507
Oh, my God! He's calling.

1053
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:17,709
Why would he call?
You guys just had sex.

1054
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:19,211
It's probably a mistake.
It's a mistake. Yeah.

1055
00:49:19,213 --> 00:49:20,912
He's... He's butt-dialing you.
Hello.

1056
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:22,613
<i>Oh. Hey, there.
It's... It's Aaron.</i>

1057
00:49:22,615 --> 00:49:24,449
Oh. This is Amy.

1058
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:26,083
I think you butt-dialed me.

1059
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:28,018
No. No, I... I dialed
you with my fingers.

1060
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,588
What's she saying?
What did she say? Shh!

1061
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,256
- He called me on purpose.
- Hang up.

1062
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:34,191
He's obviously, like, sick
or something, so he's... No.

1063
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:34,932
Um, yeah, what's up?

1064
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,261
I was calling to say I had a
really good time last night.

1065
00:49:37,263 --> 00:49:39,363
I was wondering if you wanted
to, um, hang out again.

1066
00:49:40,565 --> 00:49:42,934
Will you say that again, please?

1067
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:46,037
<i>I was wondering
if I could see you again.</i>

1068
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:48,540
You know what? I'm gonna call
the police because he's a...

1069
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,308
Hold on, hold on.

1070
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:53,044
Uh, yeah, I'll just talk to you
about it tomorrow at the interview.

1071
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:54,980
<i>Okay?</i> Oh, yes!

1072
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:56,815
Yes. She said yes! She said yes!
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1073
00:49:56,817 --> 00:49:58,716
All right. All right,
I'll talk to you then.

1074
00:49:58,718 --> 00:50:00,652
Whoa, man! Huh?

1075
00:50:00,654 --> 00:50:02,286
That... That's pretty cool, man.

1076
00:50:02,288 --> 00:50:04,288
I didn't get to hear
the whole conversation though.

1077
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,991
We're gonna talk... We're gonna talk about
it when we see each other tomorrow.

1078
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:08,792
Oh, that's great, man.
Yeah, she's got a sexy voice.

1079
00:50:08,794 --> 00:50:10,260
That's great.

1080
00:50:10,262 --> 00:50:13,097
Did you guys make love?

1081
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:14,798
Yeah. Oh, ho, ho!

1082
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,099
Whoo! Shh!

1083
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:17,600
My boy got intimate. Yes.

1084
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:19,002
Sexual intercourse! Whoo!

1085
00:50:19,004 --> 00:50:21,104
Do you want to just announce
it to everybody and...

1086
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:25,509
My boy got a girlfriend. Like,
man, it's been forever. Yeah.

1087
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:27,444
I'm not gonna lie. It's been a while.
Yeah, yeah.

1088
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:29,747
It's been like six years
since Sheila and... Yeah.

1089
00:50:29,749 --> 00:50:31,782
That only lasted like five weeks.
Yep.

1090
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:32,562
There was Debbie.

1091
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:34,851
Debbie didn't even tell
you where she lived.

1092
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:37,354
Yeah, she thought I was a psycho.
She kept calling me "Dexter."

1093
00:50:37,356 --> 00:50:39,489
What I'm saying is,
you got to go for it.

1094
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,959
Focus if you want to take it
to the next level. Right.

1095
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:44,795
You have to. You gotta give it everything
you own if you want this one, man.

1096
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:47,531
It's like, when I lost
the championship in 2011,

1097
00:50:47,533 --> 00:50:49,367
I worked on my game
twice as hard, Yeah.

1098
00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:51,168
Worked on my post-up game,

1099
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,938
and we wound up winning the
championship, twice. Yeah.

1100
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,940
Yeah. I don't feel like
that applies to me.

1101
00:50:55,942 --> 00:50:58,375
But I-I appreciate
the... the thought.

1102
00:50:58,377 --> 00:51:00,511
Aaron, you have to take a risk.
Yeah, no, you're right.

1103
00:51:00,513 --> 00:51:03,113
You have to. It's like, when I
decided to go back to Cleveland,

1104
00:51:03,115 --> 00:51:05,816
I wasn't totally sure they was
gonna welcome me back, man.

1105
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:09,386
But they did. They welcomed me back
with open arms and an open heart.

1106
00:51:09,388 --> 00:51:13,323
Yeah, they did. Again, I feel
that applies more to you.

1107
00:51:13,325 --> 00:51:15,825
Um, like, I don't even
live in Cleveland.

1108
00:51:15,827 --> 00:51:18,962
But, again, I appreciate the thought.
Cleveland, Ohio?

1109
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:21,197
Talking about the home of
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

1110
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,199
Maybe go to Canton to
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

1111
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:24,734
You know Superman
was created in Cleveland?

1112
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:26,535
Yeah, no, I know Superman
was created in Cleveland.

1113
00:51:26,537 --> 00:51:28,169
You've told me that
a number of times.

1114
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,138
You ever seen a Cuyahoga sunset?
No.

1115
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,206
Do you know Cleveland's great
for the whole family? Yes. Yes.

1116
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,374
Yes, I do. You tell
me that all the time.

1117
00:51:34,376 --> 00:51:36,477
You randomly just text me that.
What's wrong with that?

1118
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:39,079
- Which is weird. It's weird.
- I got free texting.

1119
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:40,880
Why are trying to always
sell me on Cleveland?

1120
00:51:40,882 --> 00:51:43,350
When are you gonna
come to Cleveland?

1121
00:51:43,352 --> 00:51:46,052
I'll-I'll... I'll come when
I have the, uh... the time.

1122
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:48,655
I don't have the time right now.
I'll come when I have the time.

1123
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:50,857
- I've just been really busy.
- You visit me in Miami all the time.

1124
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:53,593
Yeah, but that's Miami. I mean...

1125
00:51:53,595 --> 00:51:55,595
What's the difference between
Miami and Cleveland?

1126
00:51:55,621 --> 00:51:56,621
It's... It's the same.

1127
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:01,234
- You're right. It's the same.
- Exactly.

1128
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:06,106
Okay, so you... You had the salmon.
That's about $14.

1129
00:52:06,108 --> 00:52:07,874
What are you doing, man?
You had two Cokes.

1130
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:10,276
Dude, are you trying to
split the bill? Look.

1131
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:12,345
Look, I... Look, I told you those
refills weren't free. Yeah.

1132
00:52:12,347 --> 00:52:14,013
No, no, no, no, no. We're
not splitting the bill.

1133
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:15,781
Pick up the check.

1134
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:18,251
Why do I have to pick up the check?
'Cause you're LeBron James.

1135
00:52:18,253 --> 00:52:21,787
Listen, don't look at me no differently
now just because I got a little money.

1136
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:23,622
Look, I don't know
how long this could last.

1137
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:25,424
Anything can happen. Right.

1138
00:52:25,426 --> 00:52:27,292
I'm not about to end up
like MC Hammer. Yeah.

1139
00:52:27,294 --> 00:52:29,027
Listen, you owe $32.43.

1140
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:31,063
You know what? I'm...

1141
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:33,698
I'll pay it, but you gotta pick
up a check every once in a while.

1142
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,466
No, no, no. Don't pay
the whole thing.

1143
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:38,269
Just pay your part.
It's better for our friendship.

1144
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,371
- Equals forever.
- All right. All right, fine.

1145
00:52:40,373 --> 00:52:42,207
All right. I'll put
my credit card in.

1146
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:44,242
Put a... Put a credit card in.
We'll split it.

1147
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,410
Okay. That's what...
That's what I'm talking...

1148
00:52:46,412 --> 00:52:47,979
Fuck you.

1149
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:49,213
I think... Fuck you.

1150
00:52:49,215 --> 00:52:50,447
I think I left my wallet.
Fuck you.

1151
00:52:50,449 --> 00:52:52,250
It's in the car. Fuck you.

1152
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:25,347
So that was disgusting. Yeah.

1153
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:27,349
Why Billy Joel?

1154
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:31,087
Why "Uptown Girl"?
I love that song.

1155
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:33,823
That's, like, probably
the worst Billy Joel song.

1156
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:35,592
I'm pretty sure Billy
Joel hates that song.

1157
00:53:35,594 --> 00:53:37,160
Oh, he shouldn't. It's great.

1158
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:39,695
Okay.

1159
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:41,831
So, uh, off the record.

1160
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:46,968
Do you wanna maybe
go grab some dinner?

1161
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,439
Um, actually, Aaron,
I think you're so great,

1162
00:53:50,441 --> 00:53:53,175
and, uh... but I'm a writer.

1163
00:53:53,177 --> 00:53:55,144
I'm<i> your</i> writer.
You're my subject.

1164
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:59,716
And, uh, from now on, we need
to just keep it professional.

1165
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:00,883
Okay. You know?

1166
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:02,684
Yeah. Okay.

1167
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:05,954
I think we really like each other
and we should start dating.

1168
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:09,223
N... No, I'm-I'm saying...

1169
00:54:09,225 --> 00:54:11,659
I'm confused. I-I... Am I not
communicating this right?

1170
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:12,188
Like, I-I...

1171
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:14,294
No, I hear you. I'm
just saying I disagree.

1172
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:16,229
- Do you like me?
- Yeah.

1173
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:17,798
Yeah, see, I really like you.

1174
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,366
So we should be a couple.

1175
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:21,634
No! No!

1176
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,570
I-I have pla... plans.

1177
00:54:23,572 --> 00:54:26,072
- What are your plans?
- Dentist.

1178
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:28,240
Is that true? No.

1179
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:31,811
Then let's go out.

1180
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:33,712
I'm sorry. My dad's
place is calling.

1181
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,582
Hello?

1182
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,884
Well, why didn't
someone help him?

1183
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:40,406
What is it?

1184
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,487
Um, my dad fell. He
lives in assisted living.

1185
00:54:42,489 --> 00:54:44,188
I need to change.
Okay, I'm on my way.

1186
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,057
What hospital is he at?
Uh, I don't know.

1187
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,031
Sit still, Gordon.

1188
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:55,399
- Dad!
- Hey, baby.

1189
00:54:55,401 --> 00:54:57,067
What happened? Nothing.

1190
00:54:57,069 --> 00:54:58,768
He's supposed to ring
his call button...

1191
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,537
if he wants to get out
of his chair.

1192
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:02,705
- He has fallen.
- Where's the doctor?

1193
00:55:02,707 --> 00:55:05,942
They are ignoring my pages.
If I wanted, I could treat him.

1194
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:07,877
I was a doctor in my country.

1195
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:11,113
Yeah, I'll let you know if the wound
gets invaded by evil spirits.

1196
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:12,582
Are you in pain, Dad? No.

1197
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:14,250
Can I take a look at it, please?

1198
00:55:14,252 --> 00:55:16,585
Oh, God, Dad!

1199
00:55:16,587 --> 00:55:19,855
No, it looks a lot worse
than it actually is.

1200
00:55:19,857 --> 00:55:22,090
- Who's this Moondoggie?
- Hi. I'm Dr. Conners.

1201
00:55:22,092 --> 00:55:23,926
Your daughter and I just
officially started dating.

1202
00:55:23,928 --> 00:55:26,261
No. Not officially. Not at all.

1203
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:28,429
Welcome to a very large club.

1204
00:55:28,431 --> 00:55:30,465
You are gonna be
getting stitches today.

1205
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:33,401
- Not a chance, buster.
- Dad, let him do it.

1206
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:35,069
No, what's the point?
Just leave it.

1207
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:37,038
Why do I have to look like
Kate Middleton for? Yeah.

1208
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,439
I don't give consent.
Here we go.

1209
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:40,040
No consent! Shut up, Dad.

1210
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,884
See, I need you to stop moving.

1211
00:55:46,615 --> 00:55:49,316
- What is he humming?
- Uh, Billy Joel.

1212
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:51,451
"Uptown Girl." That's the
only thing that saves you.

1213
00:55:51,453 --> 00:55:55,322
I like Billy Joel. I saw him in Nassau
Coliseum, Nylon... Curtain Tour.

1214
00:55:55,324 --> 00:55:57,123
Oh, Nylon Curtain Tour?
That's awesome.

1215
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,125
You know, I saw him
with Elton John in Shea Stadium.

1216
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:00,961
It was great.
Of course you did.

1217
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:02,996
Nothing better than
down-to-earth,

1218
00:56:02,998 --> 00:56:06,500
blue collar Billy Joel with Elton
John, the queen of England.

1219
00:56:06,502 --> 00:56:09,936
Hey, uh, Amy tells me that you're
a, uh, Mets fan. Is that right?

1220
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:12,069
I'm a supporter of the
New York Metropolitans.

1221
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:12,839
That is correct.

1222
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:14,907
What about it? Would you
like to hear some trivia?

1223
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:18,978
Oh, distracting me like I'm a young girl
getting her ears pierced? Go ahead.

1224
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,648
Can you name nine major league teams
that don't end with the letter "S."

1225
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,417
Child's play.

1226
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:26,419
The Jazz, Utah Jazz.

1227
00:56:26,421 --> 00:56:28,421
You got the Miami Heat.
You got the White Sox.

1228
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:31,792
What's up? I shouldn't
be telling you this,

1229
00:56:31,794 --> 00:56:34,027
but I think he's hoarding
his pain medication.

1230
00:56:34,029 --> 00:56:36,430
No, I got it.
Ease up, Martha Stewart.

1231
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:39,599
Hey! Water aerobics.
You coming?

1232
00:56:39,601 --> 00:56:41,802
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

1233
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:44,671
Meryl's wearing a two-piece.

1234
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:50,342
The guy died three years ago
and nobody alerted him.

1235
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:55,180
Thank you so much.
Hey, no problem.

1236
00:56:55,182 --> 00:56:58,650
No, I... My dad's really not
a bad guy, Oh, he's fine.

1237
00:56:58,652 --> 00:57:01,987
But you caught him on an off day.
No, no. He was fine.

1238
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:05,023
Uh, you know what? What I'll do is,
I'll check up on him next week.

1239
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:06,959
And I told him about this
immune suppressant that...

1240
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:09,661
Will you please
come home with me?

1241
00:57:09,663 --> 00:57:12,131
Uh...

1242
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:13,732
Forget it. N-No, no, no.

1243
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,333
No. No! No, no, no.
You know what?

1244
00:57:15,335 --> 00:57:18,203
Hey, you know what?
Let's, um... Let's get food.

1245
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:22,139
Do you wanna get some food?
Do you wanna get some raviolis?

1246
00:57:22,141 --> 00:57:23,808
Raviolis? I'm serious.
Yeah, yeah.

1247
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,143
Do you wanna get some raviolis? I
know a place that's around here.

1248
00:57:26,145 --> 00:57:28,879
They-They have great raviolis.

1249
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:31,148
I'd love to get raviolis.

1250
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,749
Just go to the ravioli place.
Just get 'em.

1251
00:57:32,751 --> 00:57:34,650
Yeah. Yeah?

1252
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:52,603
Yeah. Yeah.

1253
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:54,906
Stop doing that.

1254
00:57:54,908 --> 00:57:57,508
Why are you breathing weird?
I'm not breathing weird.

1255
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,079
What's going on?

1256
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:04,347
I like him so much.

1257
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:06,583
Yeah?

1258
00:58:06,585 --> 00:58:10,053
Why do I feel, like, so...
Like, so scared?

1259
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:14,558
Well, because you've always dated dummies
you weren't at risk of actually liking.

1260
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,226
C... Can we get a drink? No!

1261
00:58:16,228 --> 00:58:17,861
No, no, we can get one drink.
Stop it!

1262
00:58:17,863 --> 00:58:19,529
No, I-I... What?

1263
00:58:19,531 --> 00:58:21,531
I've been dating for
fucking 90 years.

1264
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:24,067
Something always happens. Why not
this time that I really care?

1265
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:26,069
What could possibly happen? What
do you think is gonna happen?

1266
00:58:26,071 --> 00:58:28,371
What if I, like, forget
to flush the toilet...

1267
00:58:28,373 --> 00:58:31,074
and there's, like, a
tampon in there? Okay.

1268
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:34,544
And not like a cute, like,
"Oh, it's the last day."

1269
00:58:34,546 --> 00:58:36,613
Like, a real tampon.

1270
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:38,448
I'm talking, like,
a crime scene tampon.

1271
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,361
Like... Like, the Red
Wedding, Game of Thrones.

1272
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:42,452
Oh, that bloody.

1273
00:58:42,454 --> 00:58:45,221
Oh, my gosh! It's like
a Quentin Tarantino,

1274
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:48,725
<i>Django,</i> like, a real
motherfucker of a tampon.

1275
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,727
Like you... There's,
like, an ear on it.

1276
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,930
You know what I mean though...
Oh, my gosh.

1277
00:58:53,932 --> 00:58:55,398
There's, like, deal
breakers, you know?

1278
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,099
I know. Oh. Why?

1279
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,900
Hey, look who's here! Hey!

1280
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,636
This does not seem safe. Hi.

1281
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,304
- Whoo!
- Oh, my God.

1282
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:04,139
Always here.

1283
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:06,976
Is Amy crying?
Yeah, she's in love.

1284
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:08,911
Oh, with Steven? No!

1285
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:10,846
- No!
- I love Steven.

1286
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:13,983
He taught me this workout to
get me a beach bod. Okay.

1287
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,484
- You look amazing.
- Thank you so much.

1288
00:59:15,486 --> 00:59:17,967
You'll be really ripping it up.

1289
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,293
Oh! Oh!

1290
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:25,861
That was cool.

1291
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,531
- Oh! And there he is!
- Thank you, thank you.

1292
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,299
It's LeBron. LeBron!

1293
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,135
I'm LeBron James, and welcome
to the Big Apple Jam Fest.

1294
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,307
So, are you guys ready
to have some fun?

1295
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,048
The Knicks City Dancers!

1296
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:52,053
Whoo!

1297
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,389
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

1298
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,395
They're just gyrating.

1299
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:03,664
No, they're not. No, no, no. These
girls work really hard. I treat them.

1300
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,534
You tre... You treat them? Yes, I do.
I work with them.

1301
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,369
They get bad injuries. I bet.

1302
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,570
The pole isn't always
greased right.

1303
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:15,908
You're gonna lose us
the right to vote!

1304
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,982
How long is this?
I... I don't know.

1305
01:00:22,984 --> 01:00:24,851
Like, I don't know maybe another
hour or something. I'm just asking.

1306
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,319
Okay.

1307
01:00:30,424 --> 01:00:32,525
Whoo!

1308
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:34,193
Dr. Conners.

1309
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:36,829
Do you mind taking a look at my ankle?
I think I rolled it.

1310
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:38,397
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

1311
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:41,501
Yeah, I'll-I'll
see you in a sec.

1312
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:50,543
Hey! Hey.

1313
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:53,246
You were so great. Everybody flipped
out when you came out here.

1314
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:55,049
It was cool to see. Thank you.

1315
01:00:57,851 --> 01:01:00,053
But seriously, like,
you know, what's the deal?

1316
01:01:00,055 --> 01:01:01,975
You know,
what's your intentions?

1317
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:05,458
- My intentions?
- Yeah, with my boy.

1318
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,794
- Like, what's your plan?
- Oh, I don't have a plan with Aaron.

1319
01:01:08,796 --> 01:01:12,031
I... No, we've just been dating
for, like, six weeks, and, uh...

1320
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:13,899
We're just hanging out. Okay.

1321
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:15,700
Keeping it "cazh."

1322
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:19,437
So, like, you know, you get
butterflies when you hear his name?

1323
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:21,272
Excuse me?

1324
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:23,508
When you're looking at clouds,
do you see his face?

1325
01:01:25,878 --> 01:01:29,199
Do you hear his name when
you listen to the wind?

1326
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:30,847
Um...

1327
01:01:32,249 --> 01:01:34,283
Yes?

1328
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:37,754
I really have to
ask you a question.

1329
01:01:37,756 --> 01:01:40,623
Don't hurt him.

1330
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:50,267
<i>So, we did it. Okay?</i>

1331
01:01:50,269 --> 01:01:51,968
<i>We fell hard for each other.</i>

1332
01:01:53,638 --> 01:01:55,639
<i>Welcome to the whitest
couple in America.</i>

1333
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:59,309
<i>How did no one mug us that day?</i>

1334
01:01:59,311 --> 01:02:00,977
<i>Look at his hat.</i>

1335
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:04,013
<i>I know. We're kissing on a rock.</i>

1336
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:06,697
<i>Do you know how many homeless people
have taken a dump on that rock?</i>

1337
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:11,320
<i>Subway kissing? Ew.</i>

1338
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:13,689
<i>I love how tall he is.</i>

1339
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:16,091
Whoa! Easy, dude.
I'm a working man too.

1340
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:18,160
All right, I get it. Hey, Noam.

1341
01:02:18,162 --> 01:02:21,863
Hey, guys! Whoa, inside sex.
I'm digging that.

1342
01:02:21,865 --> 01:02:24,132
<i>Even my dad likes him.</i>

1343
01:02:24,134 --> 01:02:25,800
<i>My dad doesn't like anyone.</i>

1344
01:02:25,802 --> 01:02:28,435
<i>He thought Mother Teresa
was full of shit.</i>

1345
01:02:28,437 --> 01:02:31,105
<i>That's my "Aaron's
apartment" toothbrush.</i>

1346
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:33,707
<i>I have two toothbrushes.</i>

1347
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:38,679
<i>I hope this love montage
ends like Jonestown.</i>

1348
01:02:38,681 --> 01:02:41,882
<i>Ooh! I think this is where
Woody Allen met Soon Yi.</i>

1349
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:45,318
<i>Okay, okay, easy.</i>

1350
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,387
<i>That was a dare, okay?</i>

1351
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,455
<i>I was dared to do that.</i>

1352
01:02:57,464 --> 01:02:59,030
What's up with you and Amy?
How's that going?

1353
01:02:59,032 --> 01:03:00,332
Amy? Yeah.

1354
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:01,833
Things are going awesome, man.

1355
01:03:01,835 --> 01:03:03,634
Yeah? Yeah.

1356
01:03:03,636 --> 01:03:06,571
Yeah. It's going real good.

1357
01:03:06,573 --> 01:03:08,239
I mean, I really,
really like her, but...

1358
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:11,376
she's... she's got
some issues, you know?

1359
01:03:11,378 --> 01:03:14,579
I mean, that's gonna happen.
Yeah.

1360
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:16,547
It's like, last night we went
out drinking, and, like...

1361
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:18,316
You? Yeah, I went out drinking.

1362
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:19,984
And she, uh...

1363
01:03:19,986 --> 01:03:21,585
And, uh...

1364
01:03:21,587 --> 01:03:23,688
We, uh...

1365
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,523
You know, I don't drink.
I got hammered.

1366
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:27,766
And then she drank a lot,
but she didn't... Barely got...

1367
01:03:29,361 --> 01:03:31,562
But she didn't
get drunk at all.

1368
01:03:35,031 --> 01:03:36,499
She's...

1369
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:42,338
So how's the sex? The sex?

1370
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,906
Why do you always wanna
know this stuff, man?

1371
01:03:43,908 --> 01:03:45,507
Listen, I'm a married man.
Uh-huh.

1372
01:03:45,509 --> 01:03:47,209
I need to live vicariously
through you.

1373
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:49,211
Just give me a couple of details.
No.

1374
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:51,880
Just like 11. Eleven details?

1375
01:03:51,882 --> 01:03:53,716
When you're married as long
as me, you'll understand.

1376
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:57,019
She knows what she wants.
It's great.

1377
01:03:57,021 --> 01:03:59,422
The sex is great.
It's rough. It's wild.

1378
01:03:59,424 --> 01:04:00,956
I mean, if it's not wild,
it's not right.

1379
01:04:00,958 --> 01:04:02,857
Right. But no, it's crazy.

1380
01:04:02,859 --> 01:04:05,527
Like pulling my hair and stuff.
Oh.

1381
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:08,429
We've never... We haven't
even laid down yet.

1382
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:12,100
Always either, like, sitting up
or against a wall or something.

1383
01:04:12,102 --> 01:04:14,602
I've never been on top once. Oh.

1384
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:16,604
We have a safe word. Already?

1385
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:18,640
Yeah. It's "calypso." Man, it's
pretty early for a safe word.

1386
01:04:18,642 --> 01:04:22,310
It is. Second date,
we had a safe word.

1387
01:04:22,312 --> 01:04:23,779
It's insane, man.

1388
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:25,614
You ready for this?
Come on, man.

1389
01:04:25,616 --> 01:04:27,983
I've been practicing.
Man, knock it off.

1390
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:30,466
Ready for this? Ready for this?

1391
01:04:33,555 --> 01:04:37,125
Yeah! Oh. It's foul. Foul?

1392
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:39,460
Yeah, man. You hit me. No.

1393
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:41,663
You use protection, right? Yeah.

1394
01:04:41,665 --> 01:04:44,565
Yeah, yeah, she's got little bowls
of condoms all around her apartment.

1395
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:46,600
Condoms? Yeah.

1396
01:04:46,602 --> 01:04:49,337
I'm not talking about condoms. I'm talking
about, like, protection, like a lawyer.

1397
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:52,173
Like a nondisclosure
agreement, you know? Oh, yeah.

1398
01:04:52,175 --> 01:04:55,243
No penetration
without representation.

1399
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:57,645
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1400
01:04:57,647 --> 01:05:00,949
Wh... What happened?
Nothing, man.

1401
01:05:00,951 --> 01:05:02,583
Listen, I'll tell you one thing.

1402
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:04,117
You don't wanna have a baby mama.
Yeah?

1403
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:05,686
Next thing, you're paying
for a Ferrari.

1404
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:08,088
Yeah. You getting her a
big house, a big mansion.

1405
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:09,856
She's gonna want
to start a jumpsuit line.

1406
01:05:09,858 --> 01:05:12,326
And you gonna have to pay for it.
You wanna go through that?

1407
01:05:12,328 --> 01:05:15,696
You gotta convince one of your friends
to say he's the dad and raise the child.

1408
01:05:15,698 --> 01:05:19,700
Who wants to go through that? Kid end up
being 6'7 ", and your best friend only 5'2".

1409
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:21,435
Eighteen years later,
the kid comes...

1410
01:05:21,437 --> 01:05:24,539
and he writes a book about you saying
how much of a jackass you are.

1411
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:26,774
Yeah. Eighteen years, man.
Eighteen years.

1412
01:05:26,776 --> 01:05:29,477
Your baby mama's car and crib
is bigger than his.

1413
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:31,712
You could turn on the TV
any given Sunday.

1414
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:34,548
Win the Super Bowl
and drive off in a Hyundai.

1415
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:37,318
She was supposed to get the
shorty Tyco with your money.

1416
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,820
Then she went to the doctor,
got lipo with your money.

1417
01:05:39,822 --> 01:05:42,990
What are you talking about? What
the fuck are you talking about?

1418
01:05:42,992 --> 01:05:45,659
It's Kanye. You're quoting
Kanye West to me?

1419
01:05:45,661 --> 01:05:47,862
You know what?
Amy's not like that.

1420
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:50,197
Amy's not like that at all.
She's awesome.

1421
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:51,898
And this is gonna be great.

1422
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,542
She's cool, and I don't have to
worry about that. All right.

1423
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:58,003
Oh! Did you let me do that?

1424
01:05:58,005 --> 01:05:59,672
Did I just score on you?

1425
01:05:59,674 --> 01:06:02,574
Yes! You are my
bitch, LeBron James!

1426
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:04,642
But not really. Not really.

1427
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:07,178
You gotta admit, that was a
good shot though. Come on, man.

1428
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:10,080
I scored on LeBron James. I'm
never playing basketball again.

1429
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:11,682
Lunch is on you, buddy!

1430
01:06:11,684 --> 01:06:13,884
Where you going, Aaron? Whoo!

1431
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,385
Aaron!

1432
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:18,555
LeBron.

1433
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:22,225
Whoo!

1434
01:06:22,227 --> 01:06:23,727
Goddamn it!

1435
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:27,963
How's work?

1436
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:31,933
Work's great, actually.

1437
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:34,235
I think I'm gonna
get that editor job.

1438
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:37,272
Yeah, Aaron's been kind of
pushing me to think bigger.

1439
01:06:37,274 --> 01:06:39,941
Can I just do this, please?

1440
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:42,477
Aaron was telling me about
this acupuncturist.

1441
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:43,879
She's supposedly amazing.

1442
01:06:43,881 --> 01:06:46,381
She helps a lot of his patients
with pain management.

1443
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:49,351
I really want her to take a look at you.
Will you do that?

1444
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:52,420
I have no desire for an Oriental
woman to touch me above the waist.

1445
01:06:52,422 --> 01:06:54,589
Don't say that.
That's disgust...

1446
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,290
It's "Asian." Just say "Asian."

1447
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:59,594
Why does Aaron all of a sudden
know everything about everything?

1448
01:06:59,596 --> 01:07:02,597
He's a doctor.
He knows something.

1449
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:04,799
He's a sports doctor. That's not
a real doctor. Let's face it.

1450
01:07:04,801 --> 01:07:07,235
A real doctor
tries to cure diseases.

1451
01:07:07,237 --> 01:07:09,804
He's trying to get courtside
seats for the play-offs.

1452
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,107
You're saying sports doctors
aren't real doctors?

1453
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:15,243
Yeah. When they said, "What do you wanna
focus on?" "I wanna focus on MS."

1454
01:07:15,245 --> 01:07:17,613
"What do you wanna focus on?"
"I wanna focus on cancer."

1455
01:07:17,615 --> 01:07:19,381
"What about you?"
"I don't give a f...

1456
01:07:19,383 --> 01:07:21,916
Whatever gets me closest
to men's locker rooms."

1457
01:07:21,918 --> 01:07:23,618
Okay. That's really...

1458
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,487
"I want giant, athletic
penises close to my face...

1459
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:28,288
while I'm pretending
to look at their knees."

1460
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:30,958
He's a good doctor, and he does a
lot with Doctors Without Borders.

1461
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,560
He's a great guy. I'm not
saying he's not a good guy,

1462
01:07:33,562 --> 01:07:37,764
but he's got about a month left
before you give him the boot, right?

1463
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:39,565
What does that mean?

1464
01:07:39,567 --> 01:07:42,402
He's a reaction from
the muscle-bound knucklehead,

1465
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:44,737
so now you go
for the nerdy brainiac.

1466
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:48,074
I know the way your pattern works, Amy.
I... It's my pattern.

1467
01:07:48,076 --> 01:07:49,842
No, Dad, I really like him.

1468
01:07:49,844 --> 01:07:52,845
And I just want you to be nice to him.
I want you to take it seriously.

1469
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:54,970
Will you do that? I think
we have a real shot.

1470
01:07:54,996 --> 01:07:55,782
That's great.

1471
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:57,650
You sound like a Lifetime movie.

1472
01:07:57,652 --> 01:08:00,020
One of the happy ones,
not the murder ones.

1473
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:02,489
Don't you want me
to be happy? I mean...

1474
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:05,793
You're building him up, and you're
gonna let yourself in for a big fall.

1475
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:07,561
He's gonna break your heart.

1476
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:12,132
I'm leaving.
I'll talk to you later.

1477
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:14,467
I'll tell Temembe
to come get you.

1478
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:18,171
Amy, don't walk...
Don't leave like this.

1479
01:08:18,173 --> 01:08:21,207
I don't like it when you don't
talk to me for a while.

1480
01:08:29,517 --> 01:08:31,317
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

1481
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:33,952
Oh, no, I wanna be
doing this with you.

1482
01:08:33,954 --> 01:08:36,021
It's the only one I've ever
done that we've framed.

1483
01:08:36,023 --> 01:08:37,722
It looks great.

1484
01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:39,557
- It seems like a regional thing.
- - Well...

1485
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:42,561
Hey. Hi.

1486
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:44,195
Hi. Hey. I'm Aaron.

1487
01:08:44,197 --> 01:08:46,063
I'm Kim. So nice to meet you.
Kim.

1488
01:08:46,065 --> 01:08:47,826
It's really nice to meet you.
You're Tom? Tom.

1489
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:48,800
Pleasure to meet you.

1490
01:08:48,802 --> 01:08:51,135
Hey, Amy. How are you?

1491
01:08:51,137 --> 01:08:53,304
Congrats on trapping my
sister with your seed.

1492
01:08:53,306 --> 01:08:56,240
Well, not all sex ends
with a flush and a cry.

1493
01:08:56,242 --> 01:08:58,075
You know,
sometimes you get this.

1494
01:08:58,077 --> 01:08:59,844
- That's killer.
- Come on in!

1495
01:08:59,846 --> 01:09:01,545
This is Wendy and Kyle.

1496
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:02,812
Hello. Hi.

1497
01:09:02,814 --> 01:09:04,014
It's great to see you.

1498
01:09:05,917 --> 01:09:08,150
Oh, nice. Very good.

1499
01:09:08,152 --> 01:09:11,320
What does that mean?
"Welcome to our party."

1500
01:09:11,322 --> 01:09:14,222
It's Portuguese.
Rolm's teaching me.

1501
01:09:14,224 --> 01:09:17,726
That's our son Rolm. We adopted
him about six months ago.

1502
01:09:17,728 --> 01:09:20,695
Yeah, we've been teaching him, but
really, he's been teaching us.

1503
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:25,033
Yeah. How to protect ourselves.
How to stand up for ourselves.

1504
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,935
- He has night terrors.
- Lotta lessons really quick.

1505
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:31,205
He's a very strong presence
in our house.

1506
01:09:31,207 --> 01:09:33,072
Um, we love you.

1507
01:09:35,443 --> 01:09:37,076
Yeah. Lot of lessons.

1508
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:39,711
How to get along with,
essentially, a stranger...

1509
01:09:39,713 --> 01:09:42,181
who refuses to learn English.

1510
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:44,550
He doesn't know his birthday.
He says around eight,

1511
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:46,718
but the dentist said
he was 12 at least.

1512
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,522
They know. Yeah, he's through puberty.
For sure.

1513
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:53,893
- Oh.
- Yeah, he was so small in the e-mail,

1514
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:56,629
but... he's shot up.

1515
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:58,397
Come on in the party.

1516
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,034
There's drinks on the deck and there's
food in the kitchen over here.

1517
01:10:06,272 --> 01:10:08,206
I haven't been to
a baby shower in years.

1518
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:10,943
We're so glad you made it. Yeah.
Hey, congratulations, man.

1519
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:13,879
So, I hear that you
work with athletes.

1520
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,981
Yeah. I'm a physician
and a surgeon.

1521
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:18,150
Mostly work with the Knicks
right now, but, uh...

1522
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:19,951
Oh! Very cool.

1523
01:10:19,953 --> 01:10:22,253
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
And other athletes.

1524
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:23,421
Oh. Wow.

1525
01:10:23,423 --> 01:10:25,890
Really?
Like... Like, which ones?

1526
01:10:25,892 --> 01:10:28,459
Specifically, which athletes?

1527
01:10:28,461 --> 01:10:31,262
Uh, Tom Brady.

1528
01:10:31,264 --> 01:10:32,896
Yeah. Wow.

1529
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:35,132
Any other athletes
that you, uh, work with?

1530
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:37,934
Uh, Jay Cutler. Whoa!

1531
01:10:37,936 --> 01:10:40,102
Yeah, I work with him.
Um... He's awesome.

1532
01:10:40,104 --> 01:10:42,405
Do you guys follow tennis? Yeah.

1533
01:10:42,407 --> 01:10:45,307
- Rog-Roger Federer?
- Whoa.

1534
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:46,909
Uh, Robert Griffin.

1535
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:48,777
Cool!

1536
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:51,412
Chris Paul. CP3.

1537
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,448
- Alex Rodriguez.
- Fuck that guy.

1538
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:56,284
I agree. Yeah.

1539
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:58,719
Fuck him. Piece of shit.

1540
01:11:01,522 --> 01:11:03,356
Clayton Kershaw.

1541
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:05,359
Oh! Yeah!

1542
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,194
Amy, he's great.

1543
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,828
Yeah, where did you find him?

1544
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,496
We... Uh... Work.

1545
01:11:10,498 --> 01:11:13,666
Well, you two are
really cute together.

1546
01:11:13,668 --> 01:11:16,268
You two would have
the most perfect babies.

1547
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,504
I could just eat you up.
You know?

1548
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:21,139
Yeah, it seems a little early
for this kind of talk, so...

1549
01:11:21,141 --> 01:11:22,941
It's not. If
anything, it's late.

1550
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:26,844
My life did not begin
until I had kids.

1551
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:28,847
Your life has not begun.

1552
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:32,183
Yeah, you know, I'm... I'm
pretty happy right now, so...

1553
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:34,185
Aaron, do you want a family?

1554
01:11:34,187 --> 01:11:37,989
Um, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think I'd like
to have two kids by the time I'm 40.

1555
01:11:37,991 --> 01:11:39,657
- At least. Right?
- Oh, yeah.

1556
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:42,160
Two is tight. It's tight.

1557
01:11:42,162 --> 01:11:45,329
If I were you, I would start thinking
about having them as soon as possible.

1558
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:47,065
Just breathe. Just breathe.
It's fine.

1559
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:49,033
He wants to have kids.
Like, right now. Amy.

1560
01:11:49,035 --> 01:11:50,667
People talk about that.
Not really.

1561
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:52,201
It's fine. I don't know
anyone that talks about that.

1562
01:11:52,203 --> 01:11:53,870
He's great. It's normal.

1563
01:11:53,872 --> 01:11:55,638
I think Aaron's great.
I really like him.

1564
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,673
Can you tell the members of
Heaven's Gate in there to relax?

1565
01:11:57,675 --> 01:11:59,308
No, he's too nice.
He's not too nice.

1566
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,143
Yes, he is. He's too nice for me.
You know it.

1567
01:12:01,145 --> 01:12:03,712
No, Am... I... No. He's the perfect
amount of nice that you deserve.

1568
01:12:03,714 --> 01:12:05,815
There's deal breakers
across the board with him.

1569
01:12:05,817 --> 01:12:08,083
Like, the sex is good.
It's, like, really good.

1570
01:12:08,085 --> 01:12:10,719
Like, it's great, but it's not,
like, the best I've ever had.

1571
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:12,420
You know? Yeah, right.

1572
01:12:12,422 --> 01:12:14,488
You don't want "best sex
that you've ever had guy."

1573
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:17,191
No, you wanna stay with the
"best you've ever had guy."

1574
01:12:17,193 --> 01:12:19,593
You don't. That's a creepy guy.
You don't wanna be with that guy.

1575
01:12:19,595 --> 01:12:22,329
"Best sex that you've
ever had guy" is in jail.

1576
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:24,865
You know what I mean? Yeah.

1577
01:12:24,867 --> 01:12:27,367
But I've been thinking about
maybe reaching out to him.

1578
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:29,837
Stop. Amy, breathe.
It's fine. He's great.

1579
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:31,371
You're ridiculous. Mother.

1580
01:12:31,373 --> 01:12:33,072
I'm not ready for...

1581
01:12:33,074 --> 01:12:36,155
If I kiss the belly hard
enough, will the baby feel it?

1582
01:12:37,577 --> 01:12:39,344
You wanna try?

1583
01:12:41,048 --> 01:12:43,014
I think that
the baby did feel it.

1584
01:12:46,217 --> 01:12:48,252
No.

1585
01:12:48,254 --> 01:12:50,554
Kim's great, man. Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

1586
01:12:50,556 --> 01:12:52,589
She's really awesome.
Kim's the best.

1587
01:12:52,591 --> 01:12:54,191
I'm glad I finally got
to meet her.

1588
01:12:54,193 --> 01:12:56,860
Yeah, and Amy's great,
too, by the way.

1589
01:12:56,862 --> 01:12:59,096
Like, I just love her.

1590
01:12:59,098 --> 01:13:03,299
But keep her away from those pro athletes.
You know what I mean?

1591
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:04,934
Wait. What does that mean?

1592
01:13:04,936 --> 01:13:06,602
Um...

1593
01:13:06,604 --> 01:13:08,303
No, like, it was a joke.

1594
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:10,071
Like, that she'd
sleep with them.

1595
01:13:10,073 --> 01:13:11,940
I don't get the joke angle.

1596
01:13:11,942 --> 01:13:14,642
Well, the... N-No,
not that she would, but...

1597
01:13:14,644 --> 01:13:16,745
Those are the kinds
of jokes she tells.

1598
01:13:16,747 --> 01:13:20,115
Like... Like, "I'm loose.
I'm a whore." Or whatever.

1599
01:13:20,117 --> 01:13:21,816
That's my girlfriend.
No. I know.

1600
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:23,718
It's not my joke. It's her...

1601
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,286
Those are the kind
of jokes she tells,

1602
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:27,755
which I'm not, like, for at all.

1603
01:13:27,757 --> 01:13:30,058
Like, I'm always like, "Don't
tell these kinds of jokes."

1604
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,727
And then she does. I'm like,
"There she goes again."

1605
01:13:32,729 --> 01:13:35,831
Really? But I'm just like...
Just forget I said this.

1606
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:40,468
Just, like, drag that one to
trash and just empty trash.

1607
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:42,003
Oh.

1608
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:48,810
The game is Skeletons in the Closet.
Okay.

1609
01:13:48,812 --> 01:13:52,312
We all have to admit things
we've never told anyone before.

1610
01:13:52,314 --> 01:13:53,947
No! No, Wendy.

1611
01:13:53,949 --> 01:13:55,615
Yes! I'm already embarrassed.

1612
01:13:55,617 --> 01:13:57,016
Yes, we have to.
We have to do it.

1613
01:13:57,018 --> 01:13:58,417
Okay, okay.

1614
01:13:58,419 --> 01:14:01,320
Sometimes,
after Kyle falls asleep,

1615
01:14:01,322 --> 01:14:03,689
I get up and eat Skinny
Cow ice cream pops.

1616
01:14:03,691 --> 01:14:06,292
- No!
- No, you don't. You should be asleep.

1617
01:14:06,294 --> 01:14:09,094
I know. Sometimes I have
the whole box. What?

1618
01:14:09,096 --> 01:14:12,364
That's like an... a whole regular-size
ice cream if you eat the whole box.

1619
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:15,333
I know. I know. Your turn.

1620
01:14:15,335 --> 01:14:17,469
Okay. Um,

1621
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:22,206
last week, I let my
six-year-old watch<i> Glee.</i>

1622
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,642
Too soon.
I know. I know. I know.

1623
01:14:24,644 --> 01:14:26,210
- That show's very racy.
- She's six years old.

1624
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,880
There were some, um, homosexual undertones.
I will say that.

1625
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:31,816
There were two girls
kissing in this episode.

1626
01:14:31,818 --> 01:14:34,451
And you know, I haven't even explained
to them what gay people are.

1627
01:14:34,453 --> 01:14:36,387
- Uh, they're people?
- Yeah.

1628
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,356
Okay, okay. Amy, your turn.

1629
01:14:39,358 --> 01:14:42,326
Um, I don't know
how I'm gonna follow these.

1630
01:14:42,328 --> 01:14:45,028
They were so good.
You guys are really brave.

1631
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:46,864
Thanks for trusting.

1632
01:14:46,866 --> 01:14:52,001
Um, one time,
I had sex with this guy,

1633
01:14:52,003 --> 01:14:53,703
and we couldn't find the condom.

1634
01:14:53,705 --> 01:14:58,374
So three days later, I found out
it was attached to my cervix.

1635
01:14:58,376 --> 01:15:00,677
It had been, like,
kind of pounded up there.

1636
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:03,546
And, uh, so I googled
what do I do, right?

1637
01:15:03,548 --> 01:15:08,751
So it said just kind of bear down,
you know, and just fish it out.

1638
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:11,020
Like, with... Uh, you know,
make your finger a hook.

1639
01:15:11,022 --> 01:15:13,722
So I just, you know, like,
hooked my finger like this...

1640
01:15:13,724 --> 01:15:17,827
and then just kind of beared down
and just got it out of there.

1641
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:28,436
I let Tim and his brothers tag
team me on Christmas morning.

1642
01:15:28,438 --> 01:15:31,572
And you know what?
It was wonderful.

1643
01:15:33,675 --> 01:15:35,109
I like her.

1644
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,353
<i>Hi.</i> Hi.

1645
01:15:48,355 --> 01:15:49,921
<i>How are you?</i> Can you come over?

1646
01:15:49,923 --> 01:15:51,522
<i>No. I'm working.</i>

1647
01:15:51,524 --> 01:15:53,224
Is this about the baby shower?

1648
01:15:53,226 --> 01:15:56,427
'Cause I'm sorry I wasn't nicer
to The Real Housewives of Hell.

1649
01:15:56,429 --> 01:15:59,063
No, it's fine. It's fine.
It's not about that.

1650
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:00,697
What's up?

1651
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:04,868
<i>Um, Dad died.</i>

1652
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:08,371
<i>He was hoarding his medication
and his heart gave out.</i>

1653
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:13,142
<i>Amy?</i>

1654
01:16:14,911 --> 01:16:16,344
<i>Are you there?</i>

1655
01:16:19,082 --> 01:16:20,982
A little change? A penny?

1656
01:16:20,984 --> 01:16:23,552
A nickel? A ruble?

1657
01:16:23,554 --> 01:16:25,820
Crowd fund this.
Come on. Help me out.

1658
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,665
Thank you.

1659
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:38,166
Um...

1660
01:16:52,349 --> 01:16:55,652
I had a... I had
a black boyfriend once.

1661
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:57,935
Your mother must be proud.

1662
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,557
Yep.

1663
01:17:03,092 --> 01:17:05,828
And I'd do it a...
I'd do it again.

1664
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,030
Hello.

1665
01:17:09,098 --> 01:17:10,933
Thank you for coming.

1666
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:16,938
Gordon David Townsend.

1667
01:17:19,374 --> 01:17:21,708
Not that great of a guy.

1668
01:17:22,944 --> 01:17:26,012
He was kind of racist...

1669
01:17:26,014 --> 01:17:28,548
and homophobic.

1670
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,449
He was a drunk.

1671
01:17:32,685 --> 01:17:34,953
He was a drunk.

1672
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:38,455
He once apologized to me for
missing a volleyball game...

1673
01:17:38,457 --> 01:17:40,791
that he was at.

1674
01:17:40,793 --> 01:17:45,027
He had, um, made signs
with my name on them.

1675
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:51,332
When I was 11,
this kid, Brandon Lipinsky...

1676
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,135
Remember Brandon?
He stole my bike.

1677
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:57,671
Maybe he was just borrowing it,

1678
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,908
but our dad went over there and beat
the shit out of Brandon's dad...

1679
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,077
and his grandpa and Brandon.

1680
01:18:08,716 --> 01:18:11,351
I bet he personally
offended everyone here.

1681
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,220
Right? Raise your hand
if our dad ever offended you.

1682
01:18:20,761 --> 01:18:22,395
Yeah.

1683
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:25,097
He was an asshole.

1684
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:28,901
When I asked him to tell me the story
of how he proposed to our mom,

1685
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:32,104
his response was "Who?"

1686
01:18:35,209 --> 01:18:38,244
And I know he was joking.
He loved her a lot.

1687
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:39,745
But, uh...

1688
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:49,688
He was really sick
for a really long time.

1689
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,358
Which isn't fair,

1690
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,128
because I don't think anyone
else was more alive than him...

1691
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:58,796
when he was younger.

1692
01:19:01,766 --> 01:19:05,136
He thought it was payback.
He thought it was karma.

1693
01:19:05,138 --> 01:19:08,371
And that's why he got sick.
But I don't think so.

1694
01:19:10,575 --> 01:19:13,443
I think he was the greatest dad.

1695
01:19:13,445 --> 01:19:17,214
He always made me feel
loved and important.

1696
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:20,917
I know he fucked up.

1697
01:19:20,919 --> 01:19:24,554
I know he probably
hurt everyone here.

1698
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:27,390
But raise your hand if he was
one of your favorite people.

1699
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:34,999
He was my favorite person.

1700
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,041
Thank you.

1701
01:19:52,285 --> 01:19:53,718
You all right?

1702
01:19:56,621 --> 01:20:00,062
This makes me wish they'd
found my father's remains.

1703
01:20:06,832 --> 01:20:08,332
- I'll cook?
- Yeah.

1704
01:20:08,334 --> 01:20:10,576
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1705
01:20:11,336 --> 01:20:12,536
Hey.

1706
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:23,014
Mother, can we go
to La Poubelle now?

1707
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:24,615
Yeah. Sure, honey.

1708
01:20:24,617 --> 01:20:26,316
How about a piece of pizza?

1709
01:20:26,318 --> 01:20:28,552
So Mom doesn't have to take
you to a French restaurant.

1710
01:20:28,554 --> 01:20:30,220
Pizza has gluten in it.

1711
01:20:30,222 --> 01:20:32,121
Who gives a shit? I'm sorry.

1712
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:33,789
Amy. I'm just kidding.

1713
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:36,832
We're just... I'll put
Allister in the car.

1714
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:41,665
Can we have one second?

1715
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,400
I'm joking.

1716
01:20:44,835 --> 01:20:46,469
I'm not in the mood today.

1717
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:49,338
I'm not in the mood
for the jokes today.

1718
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,972
Thought you'd be
in a great mood.

1719
01:20:50,974 --> 01:20:53,909
You don't have to pay
for Dad's nursing home anymore.

1720
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:56,177
What are you doing?

1721
01:20:56,179 --> 01:20:58,480
What? Don't push me away today.

1722
01:20:58,482 --> 01:21:01,583
I'm pushing you away? Yes.

1723
01:21:01,585 --> 01:21:05,420
You've been running away from
this fucking family forever.

1724
01:21:05,422 --> 01:21:07,655
Amy, I am not a crazy person...

1725
01:21:07,657 --> 01:21:10,157
because I got married and
got pregnant with a child.

1726
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:11,859
That's what people do.

1727
01:21:11,861 --> 01:21:14,361
Why are you even here?
You didn't even like him.

1728
01:21:14,363 --> 01:21:17,832
I did everything. You don't get to
pretend today like you gave a fuck.

1729
01:21:17,834 --> 01:21:20,000
I think that's enough
for today, Amy.

1730
01:21:20,002 --> 01:21:21,433
We ought to go.

1731
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,038
Hey. Hey. Fuck.

1732
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,739
Hey.

1733
01:21:27,741 --> 01:21:30,075
You okay? Yeah. I'm good.

1734
01:21:30,077 --> 01:21:32,510
Okay? You ready to go?
Yeah, let's go.

1735
01:21:32,512 --> 01:21:36,180
Hey, I just want you to know,
I really care about you, okay?

1736
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:38,248
And I love you. Thank you.

1737
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:41,852
What? Are you seriously
saying that to me today?

1738
01:21:41,854 --> 01:21:44,921
You're gonna say that to me, seriously,
for the first time right now?

1739
01:21:44,923 --> 01:21:47,724
They're putting dirt
on my dad's body behind you.

1740
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:50,626
Today is the day you say that?
Let's go.

1741
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:52,795
I... Is that bad?
Yes, that's bad.

1742
01:21:52,797 --> 01:21:54,463
- Bad timing.
- Sorry about that.

1743
01:21:54,465 --> 01:21:56,698
I'm sorry. Is this us?

1744
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,101
We're way down there.

1745
01:21:59,535 --> 01:22:01,569
Is this us? No.

1746
01:22:01,571 --> 01:22:03,604
There's the car.

1747
01:22:03,606 --> 01:22:05,907
Can he pull up? Do we have his number?
Is this us?

1748
01:22:05,909 --> 01:22:09,510
I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry.

1749
01:22:43,617 --> 01:22:44,917
Hey.

1750
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:46,819
How's it going, sweetheart?

1751
01:22:46,821 --> 01:22:49,621
I'm getting by. Mm-hmm.

1752
01:22:49,623 --> 01:22:52,424
Thank you for coming the other day.
That was really nice. I...

1753
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,459
I can't believe he's gone.
Mm-hmm.

1754
01:22:54,461 --> 01:22:56,761
I'm literally just sitting
here waiting for him to call.

1755
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:59,965
It feels like a... like a...
a dream or something.

1756
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:02,168
Are we still talking about this?

1757
01:23:03,469 --> 01:23:06,939
That was eight days ago.
<i>I'm</i> over it.

1758
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:11,043
It was hard, but I'm over it.
Sorry.

1759
01:23:11,045 --> 01:23:13,378
Best way to grieve...

1760
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,879
don't do it.

1761
01:23:16,716 --> 01:23:18,817
Don't. No. No. Don't grieve.

1762
01:23:18,819 --> 01:23:21,853
Yeah. I've got
good news for you.

1763
01:23:21,855 --> 01:23:25,357
Um, you know that story... that, you
know, Mr. Dr. Boring sports guy?

1764
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:27,125
Yeah. Well, uh, I cut it.

1765
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,628
I mean, I know you weren't in love
with that piece anyway, but...

1766
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,998
No, no, no. I was very in love with that.
I-I love that piece.

1767
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,881
There's nothing happening.
There's no tension.

1768
01:23:34,907 --> 01:23:35,801
There's no sex appeal.

1769
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:38,470
He's a bore. Did you
see the pictures?

1770
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:41,574
You know, we did a photo shoot.
Look at him.

1771
01:23:41,576 --> 01:23:45,811
Personally, I don't like his odd
bird face, but we tried everything.

1772
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,514
We tried a ball.
Supposed to be a sports guy.

1773
01:23:48,516 --> 01:23:50,333
I don't think he'd ever
touched a ball before.

1774
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,183
Not that kind anyway.

1775
01:23:51,185 --> 01:23:53,586
And there he is. Look at him standing
there, stiff as a scarecrow.

1776
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:55,220
These guys, they're hot, right?

1777
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:58,524
We even got him wet.
I mean, would you fuck that?

1778
01:23:58,526 --> 01:24:00,025
Sure. You would?

1779
01:24:00,027 --> 01:24:01,926
I wouldn't fuck that
with<i> your</i> dick.

1780
01:24:01,928 --> 01:24:05,096
No. We decided to go with "Ugliest
Celebrity Kids Under Six."

1781
01:24:05,098 --> 01:24:06,864
Let's get this done, Amy,

1782
01:24:06,866 --> 01:24:09,067
or we are not talking promotion.

1783
01:24:09,068 --> 01:24:10,870
Good girl. Mm-hmm.

1784
01:24:15,873 --> 01:24:18,608
You almost ready? Yeah. I
need, like, two seconds.

1785
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,277
How you feeling about
Amar'e's surgery tomorrow?

1786
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:23,013
I don't feel
any pressure at all.

1787
01:24:23,015 --> 01:24:25,015
You know, if it doesn't work,
it's just the end of his career.

1788
01:24:25,017 --> 01:24:28,052
But... Feel fine.

1789
01:24:28,054 --> 01:24:30,120
I can't breathe in this.
You look great.

1790
01:24:30,122 --> 01:24:31,221
Yeah? Yeah.

1791
01:24:31,223 --> 01:24:33,022
Thanks.

1792
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:35,625
Now, is that a formal dress?
Or what is it?

1793
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,894
Yeah. I mean, it's, like...

1794
01:24:38,896 --> 01:24:40,730
There's flowers on it.

1795
01:24:40,732 --> 01:24:42,531
It's, like, shiny, kind of.

1796
01:24:42,533 --> 01:24:44,099
Is it too short? I mean...

1797
01:24:44,101 --> 01:24:46,702
No, no, no, no. Just, uh...

1798
01:24:46,704 --> 01:24:49,638
These people are... They're
real conservative, and, uh...

1799
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,773
You know. Okay, so...

1800
01:24:51,775 --> 01:24:54,810
- They're more gown...
- Oh, yeah. A gown?

1801
01:24:54,812 --> 01:24:56,912
Do you want me to just go
into my gown closet?

1802
01:24:56,914 --> 01:24:58,781
No, no. Nah!

1803
01:24:58,783 --> 01:25:01,550
Would you grab my tiara? It's
right next to my pearls and all...

1804
01:25:01,552 --> 01:25:03,385
Forget I said anything.
Forget I said anything.

1805
01:25:03,387 --> 01:25:05,921
I didn't mean anything. I know nothing
about fashion. You look beautiful.

1806
01:25:05,923 --> 01:25:07,789
You're crazy hot. Let's go.

1807
01:25:15,564 --> 01:25:17,632
You look beautiful. I
look like a dickhead.

1808
01:25:17,634 --> 01:25:19,634
Why didn't you tell me
this was so fancy?

1809
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:23,472
Oh, come on, it's nice. You
look really nice. I'm serious.

1810
01:25:23,474 --> 01:25:26,074
Congratulations. Maybe we can talk a
little later about another charity.

1811
01:25:26,076 --> 01:25:27,809
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

1812
01:25:27,811 --> 01:25:29,645
Arnold, from Somalia.
Hey, how are you? Hey!

1813
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:32,080
Good to see you, Arnold.
All right. Tables.

1814
01:25:32,082 --> 01:25:34,316
Enjoy the day. You've earned it.
Oh. Thank you, buddy.

1815
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:36,084
Thanks.

1816
01:25:36,086 --> 01:25:38,986
Dr. Conners, welcome. Hi.
Hi. Hi. How are you?

1817
01:25:38,988 --> 01:25:40,755
Do you mind if I grab you
just for a minute...

1818
01:25:40,757 --> 01:25:42,356
to go over some things?
Sure. Sure, sure.

1819
01:25:42,358 --> 01:25:43,957
I'll be right back, okay? Okay.

1820
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:45,625
I'll just... Yeah. I'm fine.

1821
01:25:45,627 --> 01:25:47,094
Okay.

1822
01:26:03,145 --> 01:26:05,013
Would you like some more wine?

1823
01:26:05,015 --> 01:26:06,647
Yeah. That'd be great.

1824
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:09,716
- Hey, it's a luncheon.
- It's wine.

1825
01:26:09,718 --> 01:26:12,085
I'll have some more.

1826
01:26:14,788 --> 01:26:16,022
Thank you.

1827
01:26:16,024 --> 01:26:18,124
Thanks, everyone.

1828
01:26:18,126 --> 01:26:19,558
I'm Tony Romo.

1829
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:24,196
Soccer? Football.

1830
01:26:24,198 --> 01:26:26,131
Tell you what, I don't get
cheered in New York very often,

1831
01:26:26,133 --> 01:26:28,200
so this is a rare treat
for me this evening.

1832
01:26:28,202 --> 01:26:30,535
Dallas suck!

1833
01:26:30,537 --> 01:26:32,703
That's Amar'e Stoudemire,
if you guys do not know.

1834
01:26:32,705 --> 01:26:35,640
He's been following
me around all week.

1835
01:26:35,642 --> 01:26:40,379
Anyway, we're here today to talk
about our esteemed recipient.

1836
01:26:40,381 --> 01:26:42,714
No athlete wants
to go under the knife.

1837
01:26:42,716 --> 01:26:46,085
But when you do, you feel
comfortable with Dr. Conners.

1838
01:26:46,087 --> 01:26:47,886
He's not just changing
professional athletes...

1839
01:26:47,888 --> 01:26:49,587
and the way they
look at medicine.

1840
01:26:49,589 --> 01:26:51,889
He's also changing the world.
And he's helping everybody.

1841
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:54,158
From pandemics
to war-torn regions,

1842
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,727
to extreme poverty situations,

1843
01:26:56,729 --> 01:26:58,663
they feel safe in his hands.

1844
01:26:58,665 --> 01:27:02,233
To our MVP and to my good
friend, Dr. Aaron Conners.

1845
01:27:02,235 --> 01:27:04,336
Wish me luck.

1846
01:27:04,338 --> 01:27:05,978
Good luck. Thanks.

1847
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:17,182
Wow. Hey. Look at this.

1848
01:27:17,184 --> 01:27:18,649
Great.

1849
01:27:21,085 --> 01:27:23,253
Look at this. Very nice.

1850
01:27:23,255 --> 01:27:25,355
Very nice of you guys.

1851
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:27,190
It's very sharp.

1852
01:27:27,192 --> 01:27:30,961
I'll be doing the surgery
tomorrow with this, Amar'e.

1853
01:27:30,963 --> 01:27:33,396
And remember, don't eat
anything after midnight.

1854
01:27:33,398 --> 01:27:35,399
I'm hungry!

1855
01:27:35,401 --> 01:27:39,603
Uh... But I really...

1856
01:27:39,605 --> 01:27:41,806
I really wanna thank the actual
heroes from Doctors Without Borders.

1857
01:27:41,808 --> 01:27:43,774
Sorry.

1858
01:27:43,776 --> 01:27:45,910
Mark Twain said, "Be careful
about reading health books."

1859
01:27:45,912 --> 01:27:47,978
You may die of a misprint."

1860
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,479
Shit.

1861
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:51,581
Uh... Hello?

1862
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,317
<i>Amy, it's Dianna.</i> Hi, Dianna.

1863
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:55,552
<i>We really need to talk.</i>
I'm sorry.

1864
01:27:55,554 --> 01:27:57,787
Actually, it's a really bad time.
Is there any chance I can...

1865
01:27:57,789 --> 01:27:59,790
<i>No, I don't wanna hear
that it's a bad time.</i>

1866
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:01,825
Yeah, but maybe
in, like, an hour.

1867
01:28:01,827 --> 01:28:04,595
<i>You can be replaced within the
hour by 90 other girls...</i>

1868
01:28:04,597 --> 01:28:06,430
<i>who graduated from places...</i>

1869
01:28:06,432 --> 01:28:09,666
<i>better than whatever state school
you blew your way through.</i>

1870
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:12,503
I'm stepping out.
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1871
01:28:12,505 --> 01:28:15,138
<i>For fuck's sake!</i> Um...

1872
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:18,375
This, uh...

1873
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,912
Uh, this organization
came into my life at a time...

1874
01:28:21,914 --> 01:28:24,114
when I was looking
to truly make a difference.

1875
01:28:24,116 --> 01:28:25,915
<i>Which of these
can we live without?</i>

1876
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:28,118
<i>"We Forgive You,
Lance Armstrong,".</i>

1877
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,019
<i>"The Inventor
of the Pussy Magnet"...</i>

1878
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:33,188
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. <i>And "Are you
Gay or is She Just Boring?"</i>

1879
01:28:33,190 --> 01:28:34,990
<i>What do you think?</i>

1880
01:28:34,992 --> 01:28:36,791
Uh, is a family.

1881
01:28:36,793 --> 01:28:39,193
And it's a family that I'm very,
very happy to be a part of.

1882
01:28:39,195 --> 01:28:41,829
Thank you guys very much.
It's very nice of you.

1883
01:28:41,831 --> 01:28:44,364
Thank you.

1884
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:49,735
Thank you. Thank you.

1885
01:28:58,814 --> 01:29:00,347
Hey.

1886
01:29:01,849 --> 01:29:03,783
Hey. I was just coming in
to watch you.

1887
01:29:03,785 --> 01:29:05,452
Yeah, you missed it.

1888
01:29:05,454 --> 01:29:07,687
Shit. I got a phone call.
How'd it go?

1889
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:09,689
Look, Amy, I know you're going
through a lot right now,

1890
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:12,359
but I... I really... I really
needed you in there.

1891
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:14,160
Instead, you're out here,
smoking weed.

1892
01:29:14,162 --> 01:29:15,795
No, I didn't come out here
to smoke pot.

1893
01:29:15,797 --> 01:29:18,464
I came out because, um...
because Dianna called.

1894
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:20,899
Amy, I really, really
needed you out there.

1895
01:29:20,901 --> 01:29:22,635
You were my lifeline.
You knew that.

1896
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:24,370
I really can't take you seriously
when you're holding that.

1897
01:29:24,372 --> 01:29:26,338
Why... Why'd you carry
your award out here?

1898
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,407
You don't have to carry it around
like Anne Hathaway at an Oscar party.

1899
01:29:28,409 --> 01:29:29,975
Can you put it down so I can...

1900
01:29:29,977 --> 01:29:31,910
It's just... That's crazy, Amy.

1901
01:29:31,912 --> 01:29:34,246
You knew I wanted
to do that speech to<i> you.</i>

1902
01:29:34,248 --> 01:29:36,581
Yeah, I'm so sorry. I-I-I'm...

1903
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,151
I really didn't wanna
miss it, but I-I was...

1904
01:29:38,177 --> 01:29:39,650
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my job right now.

1905
01:29:39,652 --> 01:29:41,753
But it doesn't matter. You
shouldn't have your phone on...

1906
01:29:41,755 --> 01:29:43,721
in the middle
of my speech anyway.

1907
01:29:43,723 --> 01:29:45,723
That was just
so disrespectful, Amy.

1908
01:29:45,725 --> 01:29:47,425
God. All right, good-bye.
What? No, Amy.

1909
01:29:47,427 --> 01:29:49,360
What are you
talking about good-bye?

1910
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:51,595
What? I'm leaving.
We're... We're fighting.

1911
01:29:51,597 --> 01:29:53,898
We're not gonna talk for a while.
That's how this works.

1912
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:57,101
What are you talking about?
No. We're just having a fight.

1913
01:29:57,103 --> 01:29:59,938
What are we doing?
What do you want?

1914
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:02,373
Why are you with me?
I love you.

1915
01:30:02,375 --> 01:30:04,042
Why do you keep saying that?

1916
01:30:04,044 --> 01:30:06,077
Because I mean it. I love you.
I'm crazy about you.

1917
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:08,179
What do you want me to say?
We're just having a fight.

1918
01:30:08,181 --> 01:30:10,348
You insulted me, and
that's... And I just...

1919
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:12,116
We'll talk about it,
and we'll work through it.

1920
01:30:12,118 --> 01:30:14,384
What's wrong with you
that you wanna be with me?

1921
01:30:14,386 --> 01:30:17,121
I... I'm a... I'm a drinker.
I don't care.

1922
01:30:17,123 --> 01:30:20,190
I've been with a lot of guys.
I don't care.

1923
01:30:20,192 --> 01:30:21,524
How many?

1924
01:30:21,526 --> 01:30:23,360
I don't know.

1925
01:30:23,362 --> 01:30:25,395
How many girls
have you slept with?

1926
01:30:25,397 --> 01:30:27,530
I've slept with three women.
Me too.

1927
01:30:27,532 --> 01:30:29,533
I have slept
with three women too.

1928
01:30:30,535 --> 01:30:32,202
How many guys?

1929
01:30:32,204 --> 01:30:34,238
What, like, this year?
This year?

1930
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:35,806
Fuck this.
I'm not talking about this.

1931
01:30:35,808 --> 01:30:37,240
Don't say "fuck this."
Don't follow me.

1932
01:30:37,242 --> 01:30:38,908
Amy.

1933
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:41,444
I don't want... I'm tired.
I wanna go to sleep.

1934
01:30:41,446 --> 01:30:44,113
You can go to your apartment.
It's nicer than mine.

1935
01:30:44,115 --> 01:30:46,783
No. Look, my parents had a saying.
"Don't go to bed angry."

1936
01:30:46,785 --> 01:30:49,385
We're angry. Let's resolve this.
Okay?

1937
01:30:49,387 --> 01:30:51,921
- Your parents weren't that happy.
- They're very happy.

1938
01:30:51,923 --> 01:30:53,923
Fine. You wanna talk about it?
You wanna get into it?

1939
01:30:53,925 --> 01:30:55,791
Yes, please. Well, let's get
into all of it right now.

1940
01:30:55,793 --> 01:30:57,425
Okay, let's do it. Okay.

1941
01:30:57,427 --> 01:30:59,628
I'll start.
You go down on me too much.

1942
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:01,930
What? Yeah. It's selfish.

1943
01:31:01,932 --> 01:31:03,933
No, it is actually
selfish because y...

1944
01:31:03,935 --> 01:31:05,768
No, you act...
Don't look like I'm crazy.

1945
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:09,004
You act like it's for me, but really,
it's just to show how great you are.

1946
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:10,740
Like, you're
always helping people.

1947
01:31:10,742 --> 01:31:12,508
So I shouldn't go down
on you as much?

1948
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,077
Don't try and spin this as a way
to not go down on me as much.

1949
01:31:15,079 --> 01:31:18,147
That's ridiculous. Of course I want
you to go down on me that much.

1950
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:20,816
So take it down a notch?
No, keep going down on me.

1951
01:31:20,818 --> 01:31:23,920
Forget this whole part of the
argument, okay? Forget that.

1952
01:31:26,957 --> 01:31:29,878
I'm so glad you apologized.
I didn't apologize.

1953
01:31:31,093 --> 01:31:33,461
Wow. I did not apologize.

1954
01:31:33,463 --> 01:31:35,130
Are you serious right now?

1955
01:31:35,132 --> 01:31:36,931
I've been through
a lot this year,

1956
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:39,968
and... and of course I'm gonna
have some... some ups and downs.

1957
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:41,703
But that's why I need to stop...

1958
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:43,771
and then say, "Am I gonna
just follow the river",

1959
01:31:43,773 --> 01:31:45,372
or am I gonna make
decisions in my li... ".

1960
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:47,308
You're sleeping!

1961
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:50,044
You were just asleep.
No, I wasn't.

1962
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,614
Okay, good. Because I am not
even close to done. Oh, good.

1963
01:31:52,616 --> 01:31:55,283
I have a lot of thoughts, and I'm
thinking very clearly right now.

1964
01:31:55,285 --> 01:31:58,353
I'm so glad that I feel comfortable
enough with you to talk like this.

1965
01:31:58,355 --> 01:32:00,855
This is the time when you have
to look at yourself and say,

1966
01:32:00,857 --> 01:32:03,057
"Am I living
the best life I could?"

1967
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,826
"Am I the best version
of myself...

1968
01:32:04,828 --> 01:32:06,327
that I could possibly be?"

1969
01:32:06,329 --> 01:32:08,062
That's why I need to stop
and then say,

1970
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:10,398
"Am I gonna just follow
the river, or am I gonna..."

1971
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,333
Wake up, Aaron!

1972
01:32:12,335 --> 01:32:14,568
You're totally sleeping!
Mm-mmm.

1973
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:17,138
You said we're gonna stay up until
we figure it out, like your parents.

1974
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:19,340
I'm listening.
What did I just say?

1975
01:32:19,342 --> 01:32:21,442
You said, "Wake up."

1976
01:32:34,558 --> 01:32:36,325
Hey. Amar'e.

1977
01:32:36,327 --> 01:32:37,826
What's up, Doc?
How you feeling, buddy?

1978
01:32:37,828 --> 01:32:39,561
Good. You ready to do this?

1979
01:32:39,563 --> 01:32:41,363
Yeah. We're gonna do this.
It's gonna be great.

1980
01:32:41,365 --> 01:32:42,664
Awesome.

1981
01:32:42,666 --> 01:32:45,166
You met Rachel? Yes.
We've been acquainted.

1982
01:32:45,168 --> 01:32:47,035
- All right.
- - Okay.

1983
01:32:47,037 --> 01:32:50,004
- What do we have here?
- Oh, this is just a little more sedative.

1984
01:32:50,006 --> 01:32:51,773
- Hey, the good stuff.
- To relax you.

1985
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:54,108
- Yeah.
- Okay. Oh, whoa.

1986
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,410
All right, buddy. Okay.

1987
01:32:56,412 --> 01:32:59,247
So, uh, we're gonna be replacing
your cruciate ligament.

1988
01:32:59,249 --> 01:33:03,251
And, um...
Uh, do you want a coffee?

1989
01:33:03,253 --> 01:33:05,787
Hey, could we get a coffee
for... Doc, I can't.

1990
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:07,455
I'm not supposed to
drink before... Right.

1991
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:10,058
- Don't worry about it.
- Just one coffee, for me.

1992
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:12,126
Um... Right, right.
Are you okay, Doc?

1993
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:14,294
Me? I'm great. I'm great. Yeah.

1994
01:33:14,296 --> 01:33:16,597
Me and Amy got into
a little bit of an argument,

1995
01:33:16,599 --> 01:33:18,966
but, you know, I think I'm doing okay.
Oh, wow.

1996
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:20,600
Yeah, this is
gonna go really well.

1997
01:33:20,602 --> 01:33:22,970
She really lit
into me last night.

1998
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:23,766
Wow.

1999
01:33:23,792 --> 01:33:26,940
Like, really a side of her
I've never seen before.

2000
01:33:26,942 --> 01:33:29,357
Like, it got... it got...
it got dark, fast.

2001
01:33:29,383 --> 01:33:30,644
It really fucked me up.

2002
01:33:30,646 --> 01:33:33,113
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm good. I'm good.

2003
01:33:33,115 --> 01:33:36,617
We're gonna get this going.
Okay. Perfect.

2004
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:39,086
I'm gonna mark the knee...

2005
01:33:39,088 --> 01:33:41,122
that, uh, we're gonna
do the surgery on.

2006
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:43,057
All right?
Doc, this is the wrong knee.

2007
01:33:43,059 --> 01:33:44,725
I'm marking this
as<i> not</i> the knee to do.

2008
01:33:44,727 --> 01:33:48,329
This is not the knee.

2009
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:49,997
Not this knee.

2010
01:33:51,332 --> 01:33:53,634
Not this knee. Are you
sure you're okay, Doc?

2011
01:33:53,636 --> 01:33:56,003
Amar'e, I'm great.
This is gonna go great.

2012
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:58,339
This is the bad boy
we're gonna split open.

2013
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,574
You know what?
This is a bad idea.

2014
01:34:00,576 --> 01:34:03,310
Amar'e, you're nervous.
Everyone gets nervous.

2015
01:34:03,312 --> 01:34:06,147
I don't think you get it, Doc.
We need to reschedule this.

2016
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:09,083
We're not doing that. I'm gonna
get you back out on the court.

2017
01:34:09,085 --> 01:34:11,419
We gotta get you back out on the court.
I wanna see you play. Okay?

2018
01:34:11,421 --> 01:34:13,120
I'm here for you, okay?

2019
01:34:13,122 --> 01:34:15,088
You're nervous. I'm nervous.

2020
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:17,691
Amy was acting
like a psycho last night.

2021
01:34:17,693 --> 01:34:19,426
I don't know what I did.

2022
01:34:19,428 --> 01:34:23,330
I really, really like her.

2023
01:34:23,332 --> 01:34:25,532
But she's like a fucking demon.

2024
01:34:26,767 --> 01:34:29,002
She's like the fucking Exorcist.

2025
01:34:29,004 --> 01:34:32,672
I said, "You gotta let me go to sleep.
I have a surgery."

2026
01:34:32,674 --> 01:34:34,875
- And you know what she said?
- She said... "No!"

2027
01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:36,476
Hey, I'm taking a rain check.

2028
01:34:36,478 --> 01:34:38,319
I'm outta here. No, no, no, no.

2029
01:34:40,482 --> 01:34:42,148
Hey, Amar'e.

2030
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:43,782
Mr. Stoudemire,
where are you going?

2031
01:34:43,784 --> 01:34:45,851
I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get outta here.

2032
01:34:45,853 --> 01:34:47,786
Okay.

2033
01:34:47,788 --> 01:34:49,554
Amar'e. Watch your head. Wa...

2034
01:34:49,556 --> 01:34:51,289
Oh!

2035
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:52,891
Oh, shit.

2036
01:34:52,893 --> 01:34:54,859
See if I can help.

2037
01:35:00,832 --> 01:35:02,399
Hey. Hey.

2038
01:35:02,401 --> 01:35:04,635
How'd it go?

2039
01:35:04,637 --> 01:35:07,537
Have you just been watching TV
and smoking pot all day?

2040
01:35:07,539 --> 01:35:12,475
No. I got up and had some cereal.
At some point.

2041
01:35:15,412 --> 01:35:18,181
They, uh, canceled
my surgery today.

2042
01:35:18,183 --> 01:35:22,352
Amar'e didn't feel comfortable with me
performing it because I was too tired.

2043
01:35:22,354 --> 01:35:25,355
So he... fled.

2044
01:35:25,357 --> 01:35:28,758
He was on a lot of anesthesia.
He fell.

2045
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,694
And when I tried to help
him, he called me a witch.

2046
01:35:31,696 --> 01:35:33,095
Is he okay?

2047
01:35:34,832 --> 01:35:37,700
You know, and it was because
of all this shit last night.

2048
01:35:37,702 --> 01:35:39,435
Which was... It was crazy.

2049
01:35:39,437 --> 01:35:41,171
It just was bad.

2050
01:35:41,173 --> 01:35:43,173
Yeah.

2051
01:35:44,942 --> 01:35:47,044
You know, I've been
thinking about all that.

2052
01:35:47,046 --> 01:35:49,513
And I was walking over here.

2053
01:35:50,882 --> 01:35:53,417
And I was just
thinking, maybe...

2054
01:35:53,419 --> 01:35:56,086
Can I say something?

2055
01:35:56,088 --> 01:35:58,622
You know what?
It does bother me...

2056
01:35:58,624 --> 01:36:01,891
that you smoke pot
and that you drink a lot.

2057
01:36:01,893 --> 01:36:04,728
And I do care that you slept
with a lot of guys.

2058
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:08,264
It makes me feel unsafe or something.
Okay, yeah.

2059
01:36:08,266 --> 01:36:10,967
Yeah, you should be with a
girl who you feel safe with.

2060
01:36:10,969 --> 01:36:13,569
That's not what I'm saying.
That's not what I'm saying.

2061
01:36:13,571 --> 01:36:16,472
It's very clear.
That's fine. It's obvious.

2062
01:36:16,474 --> 01:36:18,474
You should be with one
of those cheerleaders.

2063
01:36:18,476 --> 01:36:21,043
Amy, that's not what I'm saying.
Just go be with that kinda girl.

2064
01:36:21,045 --> 01:36:24,313
A little Texan
with huge hair and big tits.

2065
01:36:24,315 --> 01:36:27,483
And then, when you get married, she
wants to be more conservative,

2066
01:36:27,485 --> 01:36:32,454
so she just gets, like, smaller fake tits
put in, but they still look amazing.

2067
01:36:32,456 --> 01:36:34,657
Well, you know, the thing about
cheerleaders is that they...

2068
01:36:34,659 --> 01:36:37,159
you know, they bring people together
and they make people happy.

2069
01:36:37,161 --> 01:36:40,163
Unlike you and your friends
at your magazine...

2070
01:36:40,165 --> 01:36:44,333
who sit there and
judge people from afar...

2071
01:36:44,335 --> 01:36:47,470
because if you don't try,
then you can't fail.

2072
01:36:47,472 --> 01:36:49,338
That's why you're
threatened by cheerleaders.

2073
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:52,642
That's me. You really got me.

2074
01:36:56,512 --> 01:36:58,146
All right. You know what, Amy?

2075
01:36:58,148 --> 01:37:00,414
Um...

2076
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,916
You know what? Uh, we're...

2077
01:37:02,918 --> 01:37:04,852
I have to do the surgery
in two days.

2078
01:37:04,854 --> 01:37:07,187
Let's just take
those two days off.

2079
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:10,090
And then, um,
I'll do the surgery,

2080
01:37:10,092 --> 01:37:12,192
and then we'll come back
and we'll work this out.

2081
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:14,260
You know what? I think you're right.
That's good.

2082
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:16,296
I know we're done here.

2083
01:37:16,298 --> 01:37:18,631
"We're done?"
What are you talking about?

2084
01:37:18,633 --> 01:37:20,966
Amy, that's not what I'm saying.
And you know what? It's fine.

2085
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:22,835
It's not fine.
It's fine that we're done.

2086
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,457
Because I don't need to
talk to you anymore.

2087
01:37:24,483 --> 01:37:25,537
Because the interview's over.

2088
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,439
Because your article
got canceled.

2089
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:31,442
My boss said
you were too boring.

2090
01:37:37,516 --> 01:37:39,837
All right. You win.

2091
01:38:21,759 --> 01:38:23,358
Hey.

2092
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,026
Hey.

2093
01:38:25,028 --> 01:38:27,896
How are you doing? So great.

2094
01:38:27,898 --> 01:38:29,764
It's fun, right?
This is the best.

2095
01:38:29,766 --> 01:38:31,732
I love this.

2096
01:38:31,734 --> 01:38:35,903
So, what's... Are you gonna
work at the magazine...

2097
01:38:35,905 --> 01:38:37,771
after the internship?

2098
01:38:37,773 --> 01:38:39,940
Honestly? Yeah.

2099
01:38:39,942 --> 01:38:41,908
Probably not.

2100
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,944
Why? You're so, like, good,
and you have energy.

2101
01:38:44,946 --> 01:38:48,548
Yeah, I know, but being around
all these, like, photographs,

2102
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:51,752
I think I wanna do photography.

2103
01:38:51,754 --> 01:38:53,920
Oh, yeah.
I can see that for you.

2104
01:38:53,922 --> 01:38:56,555
Like, pictures and...

2105
01:38:56,557 --> 01:38:59,725
I love that stuff, like the
photo shoots for... Yeah.

2106
01:38:59,727 --> 01:39:03,429
Hey! Last call for alcohol!

2107
01:39:03,431 --> 01:39:05,397
I gotta get outta here.

2108
01:39:05,399 --> 01:39:08,098
Oh. You...
You wanna get outta here?

2109
01:39:10,035 --> 01:39:12,602
Yeah, okay. Let's go.

2110
01:39:13,637 --> 01:39:15,639
Yeah, okay.

2111
01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:19,041
Cool.

2112
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:27,283
Shit, Donald.

2113
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:43,167
It's so nice to hang with you
outside the office.

2114
01:39:43,169 --> 01:39:45,570
This is great.
I really like you.

2115
01:39:45,572 --> 01:39:47,471
I really like you.

2116
01:39:47,473 --> 01:39:48,872
You're great.

2117
01:39:55,179 --> 01:39:56,879
Mmm.

2118
01:40:04,355 --> 01:40:09,459
Okay, maybe let's next...
next... phase it up, you know?

2119
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,694
Okay. I know
just what you mean.

2120
01:40:12,796 --> 01:40:14,329
Lie down. Whoa.

2121
01:40:14,331 --> 01:40:16,699
Hey. Oh!

2122
01:40:16,701 --> 01:40:19,268
Hey. When did you get here?

2123
01:40:21,372 --> 01:40:23,692
Yeah, let's get that going.

2124
01:40:27,176 --> 01:40:29,344
Oh, shit.

2125
01:40:29,346 --> 01:40:31,112
Shit!

2126
01:40:31,114 --> 01:40:32,813
Yeah. Shit.

2127
01:40:32,815 --> 01:40:35,349
Just feel me. Feel me. Okay.

2128
01:40:35,351 --> 01:40:37,384
Feel me. Okay.

2129
01:40:37,386 --> 01:40:39,453
You like that? Grab my tits.
Grab 'em.

2130
01:40:39,455 --> 01:40:41,955
Feel 'em. I feel like I'm the one
with the tits in the equation,

2131
01:40:41,957 --> 01:40:43,623
but this is cool.

2132
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:45,292
You wanna lick 'em? Uh... Shit.

2133
01:40:45,294 --> 01:40:48,295
You wanna lick 'em? Yes, you do.
You wanna lick 'em.

2134
01:40:48,297 --> 01:40:50,063
Sure you there? Yeah, I'm
right... Now I'm there.

2135
01:40:50,065 --> 01:40:53,000
Yeah, suckle it.

2136
01:40:53,002 --> 01:40:54,735
Shit.

2137
01:40:54,737 --> 01:40:58,039
I don't have a good angle.

2138
01:40:58,041 --> 01:41:00,474
Let me just... Ooh.

2139
01:41:04,846 --> 01:41:06,213
What?

2140
01:41:06,215 --> 01:41:08,748
You're just gonna stay
really still for me, okay?

2141
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:11,885
Stay really still. Yeah?
What is that?

2142
01:41:17,726 --> 01:41:19,992
What is that?

2143
01:41:19,994 --> 01:41:23,035
It's Adderall. I have ADHD, so it
just helps me with my education.

2144
01:41:26,733 --> 01:41:29,367
Okay, this is so great,
but what about...

2145
01:41:29,369 --> 01:41:32,069
- Cradle my bonch. Cradle my bonch.
- Your what?

2146
01:41:32,071 --> 01:41:34,539
I'm gonna take a rain check,
but how about...

2147
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:36,841
You wanna get on top?
You wanna take charge, Daddy?

2148
01:41:36,843 --> 01:41:39,744
You wanna take charge, Daddy? I think
it's... I think it's Mama's turn.

2149
01:41:39,746 --> 01:41:41,746
Yeah. Sure, Daddy.

2150
01:41:41,748 --> 01:41:43,447
Oh, yeah.

2151
01:41:43,449 --> 01:41:45,216
All right, this is great.

2152
01:41:45,218 --> 01:41:48,586
I just want you to know,
my safe word is "pineapple."

2153
01:41:48,588 --> 01:41:51,256
All right. Got it.

2154
01:41:51,258 --> 01:41:54,091
Okay.

2155
01:41:55,093 --> 01:41:57,395
- Hit me.
- Hit you?

2156
01:41:57,397 --> 01:41:59,917
Yeah, I want you to hit me.
Okay.

2157
01:42:01,299 --> 01:42:03,234
- Ooh.
- Are you serious?

2158
01:42:03,236 --> 01:42:05,302
In the face.

2159
01:42:06,270 --> 01:42:08,137
Hit me! I'm hitting you!

2160
01:42:08,139 --> 01:42:09,939
Hit me hard.

2161
01:42:09,941 --> 01:42:12,474
Oh, fucking do it already!

2162
01:42:12,476 --> 01:42:14,075
Hit me! I'm hitting you!

2163
01:42:14,077 --> 01:42:16,244
Why don't you take a little
arthritis medication...

2164
01:42:16,246 --> 01:42:19,080
and then try again.

2165
01:42:19,082 --> 01:42:20,881
You pathetic, childless MILF.

2166
01:42:20,883 --> 01:42:22,416
Hit me like this!

2167
01:42:22,418 --> 01:42:24,551
Ow!

2168
01:42:24,553 --> 01:42:26,619
Fuck!

2169
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:27,787
Shit! Fuck!

2170
01:42:27,789 --> 01:42:29,655
Pineapple! Pineapple!

2171
01:42:29,657 --> 01:42:31,256
Donny, what's going on
back here?

2172
01:42:31,258 --> 01:42:33,492
Mommy.

2173
01:42:33,494 --> 01:42:35,494
"Mommy"? Mommy, my eye.

2174
01:42:35,496 --> 01:42:37,796
He is 16 years old!

2175
01:42:37,798 --> 01:42:39,164
Fuck!

2176
01:42:41,934 --> 01:42:44,001
So...

2177
01:42:44,003 --> 01:42:46,237
you had quite a night.

2178
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:48,004
I'm so...

2179
01:42:49,639 --> 01:42:51,340
Amy.

2180
01:42:51,342 --> 01:42:53,842
Listen. We've all been there.

2181
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:57,078
Oh, yeah.

2182
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:00,641
I once fucked three-quarters
of Pink Floyd.

2183
01:43:01,183 --> 01:43:04,352
Yeah. Dark side
of all their moons.

2184
01:43:05,487 --> 01:43:07,020
Amy.

2185
01:43:08,122 --> 01:43:10,657
You're a very strong writer.

2186
01:43:10,659 --> 01:43:14,099
I will go so far as to say that
you are my most valuable writer.

2187
01:43:16,264 --> 01:43:17,697
Thank you.

2188
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:21,134
I reread your latest draft
of the Dr. Conners piece,

2189
01:43:21,136 --> 01:43:23,169
and I... I have to confess,
I spoke too soon.

2190
01:43:23,171 --> 01:43:24,770
It is very good.

2191
01:43:24,772 --> 01:43:26,605
Really? It really is.

2192
01:43:26,607 --> 01:43:28,107
Really? Yeah, it's very good.

2193
01:43:28,109 --> 01:43:29,208
Yeah. Thank you.

2194
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:31,043
You won't regret this, Dianna.

2195
01:43:31,045 --> 01:43:32,778
I know you said, d-don't...

2196
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:35,515
I won't regret what? I'm
not gonna publish it here.

2197
01:43:35,517 --> 01:43:37,817
Oh, no. No, no.
Amy, you're fired.

2198
01:43:37,819 --> 01:43:39,820
Amy, how could you not get that?

2199
01:43:39,822 --> 01:43:41,855
You are so fired.

2200
01:43:41,857 --> 01:43:46,226
My love, I can't have one of
my employees having sex...

2201
01:43:46,228 --> 01:43:49,195
with someone underage
and beating them up.

2202
01:43:49,197 --> 01:43:51,831
You know? One or the
other, but not the combo.

2203
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:53,465
See what I'm saying?

2204
01:43:53,467 --> 01:43:55,066
Hey, Dianna, we just, um...

2205
01:43:55,068 --> 01:43:58,203
Oh. Uh, you're doing it now?

2206
01:43:58,205 --> 01:44:00,738
Sorry. Should we come back,
or did it already happen?

2207
01:44:02,373 --> 01:44:04,341
- Everyone knows?
- Did what already happen?

2208
01:44:04,343 --> 01:44:05,975
Amy fucked Donald.

2209
01:44:05,977 --> 01:44:07,743
Amy... I didn't fuck Donald.

2210
01:44:07,745 --> 01:44:09,679
I-I tried... I... Can you two go?

2211
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:10,980
Yeah, you tried. He's 16.

2212
01:44:10,982 --> 01:44:12,681
Oh, my God!

2213
01:44:12,683 --> 01:44:15,016
Can you get out, you guys?
Go, please.

2214
01:44:15,018 --> 01:44:17,152
His safe word is "pineapple."
Fuck you.

2215
01:44:17,154 --> 01:44:19,020
- Fuck you, Schultz.
- Can you go?

2216
01:44:19,022 --> 01:44:20,654
You wanna line up the winners
you've fucked?

2217
01:44:20,656 --> 01:44:22,657
Get out. Hey, congrats. Nice.

2218
01:44:22,659 --> 01:44:25,593
The girl you fucked while she was
quarantined for we don't even know what.

2219
01:44:25,595 --> 01:44:27,762
I'm sorry about that.
That's so inappropriate.

2220
01:44:27,764 --> 01:44:30,231
Anyway, nice news. I know
you're close with Nikki.

2221
01:44:30,233 --> 01:44:33,114
She got the executive
editor position.

2222
01:44:33,335 --> 01:44:35,235
Oh, that's... that's great.

2223
01:44:35,237 --> 01:44:37,770
Thanks, Amy.
And that means the world.

2224
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:41,074
Although, you know, I...
I can turn down the position...

2225
01:44:41,076 --> 01:44:43,176
if, you know, you want me to.

2226
01:44:43,178 --> 01:44:45,012
Okay, yeah,
please don't take it.

2227
01:44:45,014 --> 01:44:46,546
I'm serious.

2228
01:44:46,548 --> 01:44:48,480
I'm kidding.

2229
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:52,918
You're funny. Congratulations.

2230
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,686
You scared me.

2231
01:44:58,058 --> 01:45:00,259
No, she's great.
I mean, she's...

2232
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:02,928
She looks like an idiot.

2233
01:45:07,633 --> 01:45:10,435
Okay. Go. Yeah. Go.

2234
01:46:18,035 --> 01:46:21,271
Amar'e. Hey, buddy. Hey, Doc.

2235
01:46:21,273 --> 01:46:22,939
Hey.

2236
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:25,274
How'd we do? We did great.

2237
01:46:25,276 --> 01:46:27,644
Okay. You get some sleep.

2238
01:46:27,646 --> 01:46:29,212
Did it go Tom Brady good?

2239
01:46:29,214 --> 01:46:31,280
It went better than Brady good.

2240
01:46:31,282 --> 01:46:33,616
Have you seen his wife, Gisele?
Yeah, I have. Yeah.

2241
01:46:33,618 --> 01:46:35,317
She's hot.

2242
01:46:35,319 --> 01:46:36,885
Look, you're on a lot
of medication right now,

2243
01:46:36,887 --> 01:46:38,954
so why don't you just get
some sleep, all right?

2244
01:46:38,956 --> 01:46:41,122
Isn't she, like,
a Victoria's Secret model?

2245
01:46:41,124 --> 01:46:43,390
You know, I don't know.
I think so, yeah.

2246
01:46:43,392 --> 01:46:46,894
I'm gonna be right here.
I'm gonna be on this floor.

2247
01:46:46,896 --> 01:46:49,897
So if you need anything,
you let me know, okay?

2248
01:46:49,899 --> 01:46:52,300
I follow her on Instagram. Okay.

2249
01:46:52,302 --> 01:46:54,201
You should go to sleep.
Okay, buddy?

2250
01:46:54,203 --> 01:46:55,735
Oh.

2251
01:46:56,803 --> 01:46:58,404
Are we gonna do this again?
Okay.

2252
01:46:58,406 --> 01:47:00,672
- All right.
- Yeah.

2253
01:47:00,674 --> 01:47:02,840
I love you.
Oh, I love you too, man.

2254
01:47:02,842 --> 01:47:04,409
It went great.

2255
01:47:04,411 --> 01:47:06,411
Okay. Okay.

2256
01:47:06,413 --> 01:47:08,112
And he's asleep.

2257
01:47:14,518 --> 01:47:18,188
<i>Everybody's left a dog
in a hot car...</i>

2258
01:47:18,190 --> 01:47:20,925
<i>at some point in their lives.</i>

2259
01:47:20,927 --> 01:47:23,560
<i>I don't think that's true.</i>

2260
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:25,995
<i>I trust you with my hot doggy.</i>

2261
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:36,071
Hello. <i>Hey, Aaron.
This is LeBron.</i>

2262
01:47:36,073 --> 01:47:38,073
<i>So I'm at the gym, man.
I think I pulled something.</i>

2263
01:47:38,075 --> 01:47:39,909
You pulled something?
<i>You need to come down.</i>

2264
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:42,344
Uh... <i>It hurts like a mother.</i>

2265
01:47:42,346 --> 01:47:44,179
Yeah. Hey.
I'll-I'll-I'll be right over.

2266
01:47:44,181 --> 01:47:46,502
<i>Hurry up.</i> Yeah. Just sit tight.
I'll be right over.

2267
01:47:49,285 --> 01:47:50,784
LeBron!

2268
01:47:53,121 --> 01:47:54,754
Hey.

2269
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:59,025
You okay?

2270
01:47:59,027 --> 01:48:01,527
I'm not okay, Aaron.
I'm concerned about you.

2271
01:48:01,529 --> 01:48:03,897
What, so you're not hurt? No.

2272
01:48:03,899 --> 01:48:05,899
This is your intervention.

2273
01:48:05,901 --> 01:48:09,970
What? My intervention? For what?

2274
01:48:09,972 --> 01:48:11,771
You ruined things with Amy.

2275
01:48:11,773 --> 01:48:13,472
This is about Amy?

2276
01:48:13,474 --> 01:48:15,908
You've been so sad lately.
It's scaring me.

2277
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:17,809
- Oh.
- Aaron.

2278
01:48:17,811 --> 01:48:19,477
We're concerned about you.

2279
01:48:19,479 --> 01:48:21,246
You've helped us, and now
we're gonna help you.

2280
01:48:21,248 --> 01:48:23,768
- Come on, man.
- Sit. Sit down.

2281
01:48:24,982 --> 01:48:29,385
Oh, it started and it is on.

2282
01:48:29,387 --> 01:48:32,054
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

2283
01:48:32,056 --> 01:48:35,391
Now, I know that relationships
can be terrifying,

2284
01:48:35,393 --> 01:48:38,093
but you don't just bail out
at the first sign of trouble.

2285
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:41,330
Oh, it's obvious. Aaron choking
under intense pressure.

2286
01:48:41,332 --> 01:48:43,231
I did not choke, Marv.

2287
01:48:43,233 --> 01:48:46,235
You know what? Thanks for that,
Matthew, but you live a charmed life.

2288
01:48:46,237 --> 01:48:48,237
Okay? My situation
is much more complicated.

2289
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:50,606
You know, not all of us
can be Ferris Bueller...

2290
01:48:50,608 --> 01:48:52,642
and marry the star
of<i> Sex and the City.</i>

2291
01:48:52,644 --> 01:48:54,910
Why not? I did.

2292
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:58,314
Yeah.<i> You did.</i> You married the
star of<i> Sex and the City.</i>

2293
01:48:58,316 --> 01:49:01,583
- There's three other ladies on that show.
- Yeah, one's a lesbian.

2294
01:49:01,585 --> 01:49:04,253
Now... Matthew,
that's not helpful.

2295
01:49:04,255 --> 01:49:05,854
We want him to stay with Amy.

2296
01:49:05,856 --> 01:49:09,024
Look, if he's not happy and she's
not the right one for him,

2297
01:49:09,026 --> 01:49:11,659
then obviously,
it's just not meant to be.

2298
01:49:11,661 --> 01:49:16,164
Sometimes, the right person happens
to be sitting right in front of you.

2299
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:19,267
Chris Evert hitting
on Aaron hard.

2300
01:49:19,269 --> 01:49:20,668
Chris, don't hit on Aaron.

2301
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:22,837
LeBron, don't be a cockblocker.

2302
01:49:22,839 --> 01:49:27,108
Evert is still at it, and, frankly,
it's making me uncomfortable.

2303
01:49:27,110 --> 01:49:29,610
You know what
I think the issue might be?

2304
01:49:29,612 --> 01:49:31,812
You're probably
focusing on her problems...

2305
01:49:31,814 --> 01:49:33,314
instead of looking
in the mirror.

2306
01:49:33,316 --> 01:49:36,517
- Aaron is playing the blame game.
- Thank you, Marv.

2307
01:49:36,519 --> 01:49:39,187
I bet you're not the easiest person
to have a relationship with.

2308
01:49:39,189 --> 01:49:42,857
Broderick cutting deep with his insights.
He is on fire.

2309
01:49:42,859 --> 01:49:44,826
His best work since<i> WarGames.</i>

2310
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:48,229
You guys don't understand. I tried.
She didn't wanna be a part of it.

2311
01:49:48,231 --> 01:49:50,731
Can't just run when you get scared.
She pushed me away.

2312
01:49:50,733 --> 01:49:53,468
Aaron is fearing
engulfment and intimacy.

2313
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:55,136
Okay, you know what?
You're not helpful.

2314
01:49:55,138 --> 01:49:57,372
You're not helpful.
You're not helpful.

2315
01:49:57,374 --> 01:50:00,241
And you are really not helpful, Marv.
Really not helpful.

2316
01:50:00,243 --> 01:50:02,476
Marv Albert apologizes.

2317
01:50:02,478 --> 01:50:04,812
All right. Wait a minute.
No, wait, wait, Aaron.

2318
01:50:04,814 --> 01:50:08,549
Before you go, can you
take a look at my hip?

2319
01:50:08,551 --> 01:50:09,261
Are you serious?

2320
01:50:09,287 --> 01:50:11,653
There's a popping sound,
and it doesn't go away.

2321
01:50:11,655 --> 01:50:14,555
Yeah, when I walk.
Any time I walk.

2322
01:50:14,557 --> 01:50:16,391
I can hear it. I'll see you
at the office, all right?

2323
01:50:16,393 --> 01:50:17,725
- Bye.
- Aaron.

2324
01:50:17,727 --> 01:50:19,993
Good-bye, LeBron. Aaron!

2325
01:50:19,995 --> 01:50:22,429
I thought you said he
would look at my hip.

2326
01:50:22,431 --> 01:50:24,430
Yeah, if things
would've went better.

2327
01:50:40,849 --> 01:50:42,850
Hi.

2328
01:50:42,852 --> 01:50:44,317
Hey.

2329
01:50:47,188 --> 01:50:49,455
This isn't working
for you anymore.

2330
01:50:51,225 --> 01:50:52,692
I know.

2331
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:55,293
I'm sorry.

2332
01:50:56,863 --> 01:50:59,030
I know you're sorry.

2333
01:50:59,032 --> 01:51:00,264
No.

2334
01:51:00,266 --> 01:51:03,133
No, I'm really sorry.

2335
01:51:05,035 --> 01:51:06,935
I want you to know...

2336
01:51:06,937 --> 01:51:11,040
that I act like...

2337
01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:15,411
everything you do in your life
is so wrong and stupid.

2338
01:51:15,413 --> 01:51:19,347
But it's just because I... I don't
think that I can have that.

2339
01:51:20,950 --> 01:51:23,151
I'm not okay.

2340
01:51:24,453 --> 01:51:25,886
I'm not okay, Kimmy.

2341
01:51:27,222 --> 01:51:29,489
I know what I am.

2342
01:51:29,491 --> 01:51:32,224
I know who I am and I'm...

2343
01:51:33,961 --> 01:51:37,229
I'm broken.

2344
01:51:37,231 --> 01:51:40,399
Mother, Dad needs you.

2345
01:51:40,401 --> 01:51:42,267
We're talking right now.
What's going on?

2346
01:51:42,269 --> 01:51:44,402
I don't know.
He's just yelling.

2347
01:51:44,404 --> 01:51:45,937
Okay.

2348
01:51:45,939 --> 01:51:48,180
Is it okay? Okay.

2349
01:51:58,318 --> 01:52:00,252
What you got there?

2350
01:52:00,254 --> 01:52:03,022
Uh, my drawings for Minecraft.

2351
01:52:05,158 --> 01:52:07,459
For what? Minecraft.

2352
01:52:07,461 --> 01:52:11,763
It's a game where you can build
a whole virtual world...

2353
01:52:11,765 --> 01:52:13,765
and put whatever
you want in it...

2354
01:52:13,767 --> 01:52:18,637
and make it big
or small or whatever.

2355
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,107
Let me see. Yeah.

2356
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:23,442
If it's a video game,
why is it in a notebook?

2357
01:52:23,444 --> 01:52:25,977
Oh, I... I draw it out first,
you know, to plan it...

2358
01:52:25,979 --> 01:52:30,047
so I know what to build
and what to put in it...

2359
01:52:30,049 --> 01:52:32,382
instead of just winging it.

2360
01:52:34,686 --> 01:52:37,354
What's this?
Oh, this is our house.

2361
01:52:37,356 --> 01:52:40,991
Here's my bedroom.
Here's the baby's room.

2362
01:52:40,993 --> 01:52:43,059
What's that rectangle?

2363
01:52:43,061 --> 01:52:46,229
It's the mattress for you and Aaron
to stay in once the baby's born.

2364
01:52:49,132 --> 01:52:50,900
That's for me?

2365
01:52:50,902 --> 01:52:53,903
You and Aaron. Yeah. Yeah.

2366
01:52:53,905 --> 01:52:57,040
That's really cool, Allister.
Thank you.

2367
01:52:57,042 --> 01:53:00,009
But you know what? I don't think
Aaron's gonna be around much anymore.

2368
01:53:00,011 --> 01:53:01,844
So...

2369
01:53:01,846 --> 01:53:04,580
Oh. You don't like him anymore.

2370
01:53:06,049 --> 01:53:09,819
I like him more than anybody.
He's my best friend.

2371
01:53:09,821 --> 01:53:11,461
Then we should
have him come over.

2372
01:53:16,726 --> 01:53:19,427
Yeah. Yeah.

2373
01:53:19,429 --> 01:53:21,596
We should.

2374
01:53:23,765 --> 01:53:26,768
The baby's room is pink.

2375
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:29,003
It's a girl?

2376
01:53:29,938 --> 01:53:31,939
It's a girl.

2377
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:35,610
That is... That's amazing.
Congrats.

2378
01:53:35,612 --> 01:53:37,678
That's so cool. No, it's not.

2379
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:40,081
It's not. It's the worst
thing in the world.

2380
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:42,416
It really sucks. She's doomed.

2381
01:53:42,418 --> 01:53:44,184
No, she'll be fine.

2382
01:53:44,186 --> 01:53:46,453
She's got us.

2383
01:53:46,455 --> 01:53:48,188
She'll be fine.

2384
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:50,123
I miss Dad too.

2385
01:53:50,125 --> 01:53:52,259
I know that.

2386
01:53:52,261 --> 01:53:54,461
Come here.

2387
01:53:55,963 --> 01:53:57,464
I got you.

2388
01:53:58,933 --> 01:54:02,903
I'm uncomfortable.

2389
01:54:02,905 --> 01:54:04,471
We're together.

2390
01:54:04,473 --> 01:54:06,473
Receive... The love.

2391
01:54:06,475 --> 01:54:09,076
Get outta here.

2392
01:54:09,078 --> 01:54:12,079
Too much intimacy.
Love overload.

2393
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:14,441
Accept it.
I'm exiting this hug.

2394
01:54:27,263 --> 01:54:28,997
Urban Outfitter, help me out.
Come on, buddy.

2395
01:54:28,999 --> 01:54:31,099
Hey, Noam. What's up, Amy?

2396
01:54:31,101 --> 01:54:33,802
- A gift.
- Booze, pot, drugs.

2397
01:54:33,804 --> 01:54:38,273
And a place to live.
Amy, you are the best.

2398
01:54:38,275 --> 01:54:40,342
You got it, man. Oh, God. I
gotta give you something.

2399
01:54:40,344 --> 01:54:42,143
No, it's okay. How
about a reach around?

2400
01:54:42,145 --> 01:54:44,178
Oh, I don't need a reach around.
Thanks, man.

2401
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:48,482
"The most important play of the
season is about to take place..."

2402
01:54:48,484 --> 01:54:51,486
and there isn't a scoreboard,
fan or cheerleader in sight.

2403
01:54:51,488 --> 01:54:54,755
<i>The man on the spot
is Aaron Conners.</i>

2404
01:54:54,757 --> 01:54:59,459
<i>And his arena is a silent, antiseptic
operating room on a Tuesday morning...</i>

2405
01:54:59,461 --> 01:55:03,830
<i>where he's about to sew Amar'e Stoudemire's
battered $20 million knee together.</i>

2406
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,499
<i>Time is ticking.</i>

2407
01:55:06,501 --> 01:55:09,603
<i>Pressure builds,
and he goes for it.</i>

2408
01:55:09,605 --> 01:55:11,438
<i>I, on the other hand,
just woke up,</i>

2409
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,873
<i>still drunk with dried cheese
under my fingernails,</i>

2410
01:55:13,875 --> 01:55:15,976
<i>leading me to believe
that I ordered fries...</i>

2411
01:55:15,978 --> 01:55:17,610
<i>before passing out
on the floor.</i>

2412
01:55:18,878 --> 01:55:20,846
<i>Life hurts.</i>

2413
01:55:20,848 --> 01:55:24,316
<i>But spending time with Dr. Conners
showed me that you can't play scared.</i>

2414
01:55:24,318 --> 01:55:28,787
<i>And maybe every drunken night, accidental
ride on the Staten Island Ferry...</i>

2415
01:55:28,789 --> 01:55:32,023
<i>and awkward sexual encounter
were just practice for this.</i>

2416
01:55:32,025 --> 01:55:33,759
<i>"The main event."</i>

2417
01:55:37,563 --> 01:55:39,498
<i>Since the beginning
of training camp,</i>

2418
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:43,068
<i>Knick fans have wondered, when do
they get back their number one?</i>

2419
01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:45,171
<i>Well, the answer is tonight.</i>

2420
01:55:45,173 --> 01:55:49,174
<i>Amar'e Stoudemire is back
in action for the Knicks.</i>

2421
01:55:56,182 --> 01:56:00,485
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm Marv Albert, and welcome
to sold-out Madison Square Garden,</i>

2422
01:56:00,487 --> 01:56:02,688
<i>where Knicks fans
are holding their breath...</i>

2423
01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:07,024
<i>to see if Amar'e Stoudemire's surgically
repaired knee will bring new hope...</i>

2424
01:56:07,026 --> 01:56:09,360
<i>as they tip off another season,</i>

2425
01:56:09,362 --> 01:56:12,696
<i>looking to get back
into the play-off picture.</i>

2426
01:56:12,698 --> 01:56:16,834
<i>It's the Knicks and the Nets,
coming up next.</i>

2427
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:18,602
How you doing, man?

2428
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:20,605
I'm gonna ask you this question.
How are you feeling?

2429
01:56:20,607 --> 01:56:22,373
How's the knee feeling? Feels good.
Feels great.

2430
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:23,907
Yeah. It's okay? Yeah.
It's awesome.

2431
01:56:23,909 --> 01:56:25,441
Taxi!

2432
01:56:28,045 --> 01:56:31,347
Oh, taxi! What is going on?

2433
01:56:31,349 --> 01:56:33,917
Amar'e Stoudemire
is checking in.

2434
01:56:33,919 --> 01:56:37,287
And it is a standing ovation.

2435
01:56:40,725 --> 01:56:45,296
<i>Number one, Amar'e Stoudemire!</i>

2436
01:57:05,052 --> 01:57:07,286
Why are we stopped?

2437
01:57:07,288 --> 01:57:09,455
You know, sometimes
on these short trains,

2438
01:57:09,457 --> 01:57:11,757
you know, it doesn't touch
that third rail,

2439
01:57:11,759 --> 01:57:13,425
you know, where
the electricity is?

2440
01:57:13,427 --> 01:57:16,128
So the red signal comes on and
the power just shuts off.

2441
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:18,763
Really? No, not really.
I don't fucking know.

2442
01:57:18,765 --> 01:57:21,133
Do I look like I work for MTA?
I don't know.

2443
01:57:21,135 --> 01:57:23,802
What, I got MetroCards in my
fucking purse now? Oh. Sorry.

2444
01:57:23,804 --> 01:57:26,237
What the fuck, man? You
ask me some stupid shit.

2445
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:27,772
I'm sorry. I don't work here.

2446
01:57:27,774 --> 01:57:29,406
Don't lean into me.

2447
01:57:29,408 --> 01:57:31,274
Pierce, off the drive.

2448
01:57:31,276 --> 01:57:33,744
It is blocked by Stoudemire!

2449
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:35,312
And then comes up
with the ball.

2450
01:57:35,314 --> 01:57:37,947
Under four to play
here in the first.

2451
01:57:37,949 --> 01:57:40,917
Smith. Finding Stoudemire!

2452
01:57:40,919 --> 01:57:44,186
Beautiful play!
And that gets the crowd going.

2453
01:58:00,472 --> 01:58:03,107
Hey, Dr. Conners. Oh. Hey.

2454
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:04,942
Amar'e looked good tonight.
Yeah, he did.

2455
01:58:04,944 --> 01:58:06,710
I'm happy for him. Actually,
he's looking for you.

2456
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:08,345
He said to meet him
out on court.

2457
01:58:08,347 --> 01:58:09,446
On court? Yeah.

2458
01:58:09,448 --> 01:58:10,513
Right now? Right now.

2459
01:58:10,515 --> 01:58:11,675
Uh... Okay.

2460
01:58:44,884 --> 01:58:46,651
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

2461
01:58:47,686 --> 01:58:48,986
Amy?

2462
01:59:13,111 --> 01:59:14,911
<i>Let's get ridiculous!</i>

2463
01:59:23,552 --> 01:59:24,618
<i>Yeah!</i>

2464
01:59:25,519 --> 01:59:27,721
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

2465
01:59:27,723 --> 01:59:29,856
- <i>Let's get ridiculous!</i>
- You're really good!

2466
02:00:47,468 --> 02:00:48,633
Come here.

2467
02:00:48,635 --> 02:00:50,101
Hey.

2468
02:00:50,103 --> 02:00:52,537
Hi. I'm sorry. No, no, no.
I'm sorry.

2469
02:00:52,539 --> 02:00:55,206
No. You were really,
really good.

2470
02:00:55,208 --> 02:00:58,210
As it turns out, I am in terrible
physical shape. Yeah, I saw that.

2471
02:00:58,212 --> 02:00:59,844
Could you see that? Yeah, yeah.

2472
02:00:59,846 --> 02:01:01,979
I am sweating more than
I am proud of. Yeah.

2473
02:01:01,981 --> 02:01:03,648
No, no. I know. Hey.

2474
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:05,516
What? I really missed you.

2475
02:01:05,518 --> 02:01:07,184
I missed you.

2476
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:14,023
What? Amy, you really
don't need to do that.

2477
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:18,127
Why is there a mat?

2478
02:01:18,129 --> 02:01:19,889
Oh, shit. These guys.

2479
02:01:24,634 --> 02:01:26,402
Hey.

2480
02:01:30,473 --> 02:01:33,954
No, no, no, no. Amy, you can't.
Bad idea!

2481
02:01:36,678 --> 02:01:38,312
Honey! Honey! No!

2482
02:01:38,314 --> 02:01:40,514
No! No!

2483
02:01:40,516 --> 02:01:42,082
Amy! No!

2484
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:52,026
Amy? Amy?

2485
02:01:52,028 --> 02:01:53,594
Amy. Amy, honey.

2486
02:01:53,596 --> 02:01:55,696
You okay? Did I get it?

2487
02:01:55,698 --> 02:01:57,699
Did you get the basket?
Did it go in?

2488
02:01:57,701 --> 02:01:59,400
Oh, of course not.

2489
02:01:59,402 --> 02:02:01,101
You didn't get enough height.
No?

2490
02:02:01,103 --> 02:02:03,370
No. I thought I got
a lot of height.

2491
02:02:03,372 --> 02:02:06,539
No, no. Zero height.
No height, huh?

2492
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:08,909
Usually when people hit
trampolines, they go high,

2493
02:02:08,911 --> 02:02:11,011
but for some reason
you went down.

2494
02:02:11,013 --> 02:02:13,279
You went straight down.
Hard. I went down.

2495
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:15,715
I really wanna impress you.
Yeah?

2496
02:02:15,717 --> 02:02:17,283
Yeah, I wanna show you
I can work hard...

2497
02:02:17,285 --> 02:02:19,685
and put myself
out there, you know?

2498
02:02:19,687 --> 02:02:21,688
No, I got that. And not
be afraid to fail.

2499
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:23,690
No. I got... I got the metaphor.

2500
02:02:23,692 --> 02:02:25,414
'Cause with the dance, I
wanna show you, like, us.

2501
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:26,293
Yeah, I got the metaphor.

2502
02:02:26,295 --> 02:02:28,295
'Cause, like, I really wanna try.
Yeah.

2503
02:02:28,297 --> 02:02:29,863
I wanna try with you.

2504
02:02:31,432 --> 02:02:33,133
I wanna try too.

2505
02:02:33,135 --> 02:02:35,602
I love you.

2506
02:02:35,604 --> 02:02:37,670
Yeah? Yeah.

2507
02:02:38,539 --> 02:02:40,473
I love you too, Amy.

2508
02:02:44,612 --> 02:02:46,212
Aw!
